How to DDoS Like an Ethical Hacker

Before I tell you how to DDoS someone, I want to make a few issues clear. Launching a Distributed Denial of Service attack for any other reasons than security testing is illegal.
In ethical hacking, DDoS attacks can be used as part of security testing and vulnerability assessment activities. If that is the case, make sure that strict guidelines and legal agreements are in place before you get to work.
You will need the explicit consent of the organization being tested, and you should be able to control the attack carefully, to avoid causing real harm. Unauthorized DDoS attacks are illegal and can result in serious legal consequences.
What Is a DDoS Attack?
A DDoS attack is a denial of service (DoS) attack that uses a botnet to flood the target with malicious traffic.
Hackers launch DDoS attacks to disrupt or put down a website or service. They achieve this by sending the web server more requests than the target website can process. Because of DDoS attacks, an organization`s users will either:
not be able to access the information they need anymore,
will have to deal with a very slow-working application.
While DoS attacks use only one source to send the information, a DDoS attack uses thousands, or hundreds of thousands of infected devices to flood its target. Thus, DDoS attacks hit harder than DoS ones.
The Purpose of a DDoS Attack
Threat actors use DDoS attacks for various purposes. Unlike in ransomware attacks` case, there are no fast-financial gains expected when planning a DDoS attack. However, it might happen that hackers try to extort a company by using DDoS as a weapon. Here below are the reasons why hackers launch DDoS attacks:
DDoS as an Obfuscation Technique
In many cases, hackers use DDoS attacks as smokescreens. By putting the target`s web server down, they try to hide the real endgame: malware deployment or data exfiltration.
Putting down competitors
Cybercriminals might use DDoS attacks as a blunt weapon against competitors. For instance, they might want to bring down a site hosting a cybersecurity tool or bring down a small online shop operating in the same niche.
Extortion attempts
Malicious actors sometimes ask their victims to pay a fee in order for the distributed denial of service to stop.
Hacktivism
Hacktivists are activists that use cybercrime as a protest tool. DDoS attacks are cheap, and relatively easy to pull off, since there are plenty of free DDoS tools available. So, they became a favorite way for certain activism groups to make a point. Their goal is to disrupt online services and websites belonging to target organizations in order to draw attention.
Hacktivists use DDoS attacks also because they can launch them anonymously, so authorities will have a hard time finding out who did it.
Not all hacktivists fight for a good cause. State-supported hackers, like pro-Russia KillNet threat group, use DDoS attacks to disrupt other governments` activities. Like targeting healthcare organizations.
Fun and glory
Sometimes, the attacker might not even have a motive. He just does it for the “giggles”, seeking to test his abilities or just to cause mayhem. So, no matter how small and allegedly insignificant an organization seems, there is a possibility that hackers target it in a DDoS attack. This means that all CIOs or CTOs of a company should take the appropriate security measures to avoid a DDoS attack.
System Testing
In red teaming exercises, ethical hackers simulate real-world attack scenarios, to assess an organization’s overall security posture. These may include DDoS attacks. The activity can be part of a broader set of tactics to evaluate how well an organization can defend against multiple attack vectors.
Ethical hackers use controlled and limited DDoS attacks to test a system’s resilience and ability to handle a sudden influx of traffic. This helps them identify weaknesses in the infrastructure:
inadequate network bandwidth,
poorly configured load balancers,
insufficient server resources.
How to DDoS Someone
There’s more than one way of carrying out a denial of service attack. Some methods are easier to execute than others, but not as powerful. Sometimes, the attacker might want to go the extra mile, to really be sure the victim gets the message, so he can hire a dedicated botnet to carry out the attack.
Botnets
A botnet is a collection of computers or other Internet-connected devices that have been infected with malware, and now respond to the orders and commands of a central computer, called the Command-and-Control Center.
The big botnets have a web of millions of devices, and most of the owners have no clue their machines are compromised. Besides multiple computers, a botnet can also include IoT devices.
Usually, botnets are used for a wide variety of illegal activities, such as pushing out spam emails, phishing or cryptocurrency mining.
Some, however, are available to rent for the highest bidder, who can use them in whatever way seems fit. Oftentimes, this means a DDoS attack. Read more about how to protect your business against botnet attacks in my colleague`s article.




DDoS programs and tools
Small scale hackers who don’t have access to botnets, have to rely on their own computers. This means using specialized DDoS attack tools, that can direct Internet traffic to a certain target.
Of course, the amount of traffic an individual computer can send is small, but crowdsource a few hundreds or thousands of users, and things suddenly grow in scope.
This particular Distributed Denial of Service tactic has been successfully employed by Anonymous. In short, they send a call to their followers, asking them to download a particular tool, and be active on messaging boards, such as IRC, at a particular time. They then simultaneously launch a DDoS attack, bringing the target website or service down.
Here’s a sample list of DDoS attack tools that malicious hackers use to carry out denial of service attacks:
Low Orbit Ion Cannon, shortened to LOIC.
XOIC.
HULK (HTTP Unbearable Load King).
DDOSIM – Layer 7 DDoS Simulator
R-U-Dead-Yet.
Tor’s Hammer.


How to DDoS an IP using cmd
One of the most basic and rudimentary denial-of-service methods is called the “ping of death” and uses the Command Prompt to flood an Internet Protocol address with data packets.
Because of its small scale and basic nature, ping of death attacks usually works best against smaller targets. For instance, the attacker can target:
A single computer. However, in order for this to be successful, the malicious actor must first find out the IP address of the device.
A wireless router. Flooding the router with data packets will prevent it from sending out Internet traffic to all other devices connected to it. In effect, this cuts the Internet access of any device that used the router.
In order to launch a ping denial-of-service attack, the malicious hacker first needs to find out the IP of the victim’s computer or device. This is a relatively straightforward task, however.
A ping of death is small in scale, and fairly basic, so it is mostly efficient against particular devices. Nevertheless, if multiple computers come together, it’s possible to bring down a smallish website that doesn`t have the proper infrastructure to deal with this threat.


Using Google Spreadsheet to send countless requests.
An attacker can use Google Spreadsheets to continuously ask the victim’s website to provide an image or PDF stored in the cache. Using a script, he will create a neverending loop, where the Google Spreadsheet constantly asks the website to fetch the image.
This huge number of requests overwhelms the site and blocks legitimate traffic.
Unlike other denial-of-service tactics, this one doesn’t send large information packages to flood the website, but instead, it makes data requests, which are much, much smaller.
In other words, the attacker doesn’t need to rely on sizeable botnet or thousands of other users to achieve a similar effect.
Teardrop attacks
In most cases, the information transmitted between a client device and the server is too big to be sent in one piece. Because of this, the data is broken into smaller packets, and then reassembled again once it reaches the server.
The server knows the order of reassembly through a parameter called “offset”. Think of it as instructions to building a LEGO toy.
What a teardrop attack does, is to send data packets at the server that make no sense, and have overlapping or dysfunctional offset parameters. The server tries, and fails, to order the data according to the malicious offset parameters. This quickly consumes available resources until it grinds to a halt, taking down the website with it.
Amplifying a DDoS attack
To maximize every data byte, malicious hackers will sometimes amplify the flood by using a DNS reflection attack.
This is a multiple-step process:
The attacker will assume the identity of the victim by forging its IP address.
Using the forged identity, he will then send out countless DNS queries to an open DNS resolver.
The DNS resolver processes each query, and then sends the information back to victim device who had its identity stolen. However, the information packets the DNS resolver sends out are much bigger than the queries it receives.
What happens during amplification is that every 1 byte of information becomes 30 or 40 bytes, sometimes even more. Amplify this further using a botnet with a few thousand computers, and you can end up sending 100 gigabytes of DDoS traffic towards a site.
The types of DDoS attacks
Denial-of-Service attacks fall in two broad categories, depending on their main attack vector:
Application layer.
Network layer.
Network layer attacks
A network layer attack works by flooding the infrastructure used to host a website with vast amounts of data.
Many providers nowadays claim they offer “unmetered” bandwidth, meaning you should theoretically never have to worry about excessive amounts of traffic taking down your site. However, this “unmetered” bandwidth comes with strings attached.
To put things into perspective, a website with some 15,000 monthly pageviews and hundreds of pages requires around 50 gigabytes of monthly bandwidth to operate optimally. Keep in mind that this traffic is widely dispersed over the course of an entire month. A site like this has no chance to stay online if a DDoS attack rams it with 30 or 40 gigs of traffic in a one-hour period.
As a self-defense measure, the hosting provider itself will simply cut off hosting you until the legitimate traffic normalizes. Although this might seem harsh, this prevents spill-over effects that might affect other clients of the hosting provider.
These kind of DDoS attacks themselves come in multiple shapes and sizes. Here are a few of the more frequent ones:
SYN Attacks. SYN is a shorthand for “synchronize”, and is a message that a client (such as a PC) sends to the web server for the two to be in sync.
DNS reflecting.
UDP amplification attacks.
Application layer attack
Application layer attacks are much more surgical in nature compared to network ones. These work by targeting certain programs or software that a website uses in its day-to-day functioning.
For instance, an application layer attack will target a site’s WordPress installation, PHP scripts or database communication.
This type of software can’t handle anywhere near the load of wider network infrastructure, so even a comparatively small DDoS attack of a few megabytes per second can take it down.
HTTP flood activities are typical application layer attacks. They work by abusing one of two commands, POST or GET. The GET command is a simple one that recovers static content, like the web page itself or an image on it.
The POST command is more resource-intensive, since it triggers complex background processes with a greater impact on server performance.
An HTTP flood will generate a huge amount of internal server requests that the application cannot handle, so it then flops and takes down the entire site with it.
How to Detect a DDoS Attack?
Analyze the traffic to see if you`re confronting a usage spike or an attack.
Traffic spikes are a frequent occurrence and can actually be big enough to take down poorly prepared websites. A site designed to cope with an average of 30-40 concurrent users will come under strain if a spike brings up the number to 600-700 users at the same time.
The first sign of a DDoS attack is a strong slowdown in server performance or an outright crash. 503 “Service Unavailable” errors should start around this time. Even if the server doesn’t crash, critical processes that used to take seconds to complete now take minutes.




Wireshark is a great tool to help you figure out if what you’re going through is a DDoS. Among its many features, it monitors what IP addresses connect to your PC or server, and how many packets it sends.
Of course, if the attacker uses a VPN or a botnet, you’ll see a whole bunch of IPs, instead of a single one. Here’s a more in-depth rundown on how to use Wireshark to figure out if you’re on the wrong end of a denial-of-service.
Microsoft Windows also comes with a native tool called Netstat, which shows you what devices are connecting to your web servers, and other similar statistics.
To open the tool, write cmd in the Start menu search bar, and then type in netstat –an. This will take you to a screen showing your own internal IP in the left-hand column, while the right-hand column holds all of the external IPs connected to your device.



The screenshot above is for a normal connection. In it, you can see a few other IPs that communicate normally with the device.
Now, here’s how a DDoS attack would look like:



On the right side, you can see that a single external IP repeatedly tries to connect to your device. While not always indicative of a DDoS, this is a sign that something fishy is going, and warrants further investigation.
Conclusion
DDoS attacks will only get more frequent as script kiddies get access to more sophisticated and cheap DDoS tools and attack methods. Fortunately, denial-of-service attacks are short-lived affairs, and tend to have a short-term impact. Of course, this isn’t always the case, so it’s best to be prepared for the worst-case scenario.

DoS vs DDoS
In this section, we will discuss the differences between DoS (Denial of Service) and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, two common network-based attacks that can severely impact the availability and performance of targeted systems.
DoS (Denial of Service) Attack
A DoS attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker aims to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming the target system with requests, it essentially becomes inaccessible due to server overloading.
Some common methods employed in DoS attacks include:
Flooding - The attacker sends a massive number of requests to the target system, overwhelming its capacity to respond and eventually crashing the system.
Ping of Death - The attacker sends a large, malformed ICMP packet to the target system, which can cause the system to crash.
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Attack
A DDoS attack is similar to a DoS attack in its intent, but it utilizes multiple computers or devices (usually compromised by malware) to launch the attack. These devices, collectively called a “botnet”, send an overwhelming amount of requests to the target system, making it even harder to mitigate the attack and protect the resources.
Some common methods employed in DDoS attacks include:
UDP Flood - A DDoS attack that sends numerous User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets to the target system, consuming its resources and eventually leading to a crash.
HTTP Flood - A DDoS attack that generates a large number of HTTP requests to the target server, which exceeds its processing capacity and causes a slowdown or crash.
Key Differences
Scale: While DoS attacks are limited by the resources of a single attacker, DDoS attacks involve multiple attacking devices, making them more effective at overwhelming and disrupting the target system.
Mitigation: DoS attacks can usually be mitigated with simpler countermeasures, but DDoS attacks often require more sophisticated defense strategies due to their distributed and coordinated nature.
In conclusion, both DoS and DDoS attacks aim to disrupt the availability of a target system by overwhelming its resources. However, their key differences lie in the scale and complexity of the attack, with DDoS attacks being more powerful and more challenging to defend against. It is crucial for organizations to implement robust security measures to detect and mitigate these attacks to maintain the availability and integrity of their systems.

What are the best DDOS attack tools in 2023?
There are different types of these tools available. Let’s check out the best 16. This list is based on a couple of criteria that include efficiency, speed and attack sophistication.
LOIC
LOIC – This attack tool is fully called Low Orbit Ion Cannon. It happens to be very useful in DDOS attacks that use large volumes to their advantage. Simply put, it focuses the network connections of computers towards specific server frameworks. Since under normal circumstances, no computer can send requests powerful enough to overwhelm server bandwidths, they prompt computer networks to send unnecessary packets to the servers that have been preselected. Types of packets LOIC support are:
TCP
UDP
HTTP GET (HTTP floods attacks)
HOIC
HOIC – Of course, they are certain limitations to the functions of LOIC in terms of volume. For more refined attacks and for more bulk, hackers created the High Orbit Ion Cannon to replace LOICs. What this means is that, HOICs can generate more requests at whim more than LOICs can, and the types of packets sent are different. HOIC can execute DDoS attacks by sending:
HTTP POST
HTTP GET
This makes it easy to execute large scale volume web based attacks in a lesser time. HOICs are known to be able to generate as high as 250 garbage packets and send them as requests to servers.  Just as mentioned earlier, attacks with this tool does not generate more bulk, those attacks become harder to detect with increasing sophistication. Essentially, some firewall systems (especially the traditional ones), would not be able to filter out these attacks.
HULK
HULK – This is like an acronym for HTTP unbearable load king. In this age where transfer protocols are the conventional means through which computer communicate with servers, it would be smooth for attacks to overload servers with many of such apparently legitimate requests. That is exactly what HULK does. HULK happen to be very efficient in executing denial of service attacks, since it has the ability of sending obfuscated traffic, making it harder to detect. Finally, these tools can be used to generate attacks that can be quite difficult (and sometimes) to detect. Of course, that is to be expected since the vehicle of execution is HTTP.


Solarwinds security management system
SOLARWINDS SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM – Unlike all other tools on the list that help you test by initiating attacks, these systems are directly involved in protection. Instead of relying solely on your local firewalls and conventional IP filters, you could use this system to monitor traffic flow and mitigate the said attacks. The system works by creating logs from requests, strengthening the logs records to create some sort of filter algorithm, constantly review the requests to a server and block off requests when it detects an alteration. This system is capable of sending emergency alerts when it discovers garbage traffic, block off the requests and stabilize traffic flow to servers. For the purpose of security, the server log in a read only format.
PyLoris
PYLORIS - This tool type is very effective for carrying out for stealth DDOS attacks.  It is another tool that is used for pen-testing by executing slow and hidden attacks.  It is used to execute denial attacks directly against the service. It takes advantage of certain server communications frameworks that use encryption and anonymity. Notable among these are SSL and SOCK proxies. It uses these means to popular server protocols like HTTP, UDP and so on.



Tors hammer
TORS HAMMER – Just as the name suggests, the tool can perform attacks inside the Tor network. By default, Tor's Hammer operates on level 7 of the OSI Model and it is attacking the whole TCP stack. The way it works is simple. The tool opens multiple dead connections and thus, hanging the application since it cannot return result. However, instead of a crushing action like the literal Thor hammer, it is specialized for anonymous attacks. The tool is built in a way that uses anonymity as a leverage to evade firewalls and security mitigations. It is also used to carry out demo attacks on security structures by pen testers. There is a downside to this tool however; the primary network (Tor) is usually very slow. This speed limit automatically limits how effective these tools can be.

SLOWLORIS
SLOWLORIS – This tool is one of the best ways to carry out DDOS attacks. It is even dubbed the most effective of the tools available. It works by sending out legitimate HTTP requests albeit incompletely. That way, with a limited bandwidth, it gets the server overburdened with requests. Also, this tool allows attackers create a connection with the victim server and keep these connections open for as long as they are needed.  The server are left anticipating several uncompleted HTTP requests, hence they have limited or no space to attend to the users. It is especially effective because the HTTP requests are not spoofed, they are legitimate.
DDOSIM
DDOSIM – This tool is used predominantly to carry out application layer DDOS attacks against targeted servers in a simulation. This tool creates several non-existent hosts and uses them to execute layer 7 attacks against these servers. The strength of the server security framework is evaluated upon the response to this attack. Although, the tool is adapted to function on other operating systems, it is written using C ++ and it functions optimally on LINUX. It works in a way that it carries out different methods of attacks, to show the diversity of approach and the vastness of a hacker’s thought process.
RUDY
RUDY – This stands for R U Dead Yet? It uses long forms to overwhelm servers in a slow and coordinated stream of denial attack. RUDY is used in some conjunction with some other tools. First, servers with web forms embedded in them are sourced out. When these servers are found and the forms have been noted, the RUDY attack tool is used to send hypertext transfer protocol requests with extremely long content.
PRTG
PRTG – This is tool that is not directly involved in carrying out attacks. It could however be useful in mitigating DDOS attacks through its operation. PRTG is the synonym for Paessler router Traffic grapher. It is used to as a stat tool to gauge server traffic, the extent of bandwidth usage and to send notification in the case of any detected abnormality in these activities. Just as the name imply, it is a monitoring tool that could give the user access to the state of the components of your network or your server or computer. It has an easy to use interface and it can function on pretty much any type of operating (OS). It is especially effective in volume based denial attacks
OWAS DDOS HTTP POST
OWAS DDOS HTTP POST – This tool can be used to examine how stable the security of your web application would be against popular DDOS forms like Slowloris attacks and SLL renegotiations. It is very effective as a simulator against website applications and in actual attack depending on who uses it.
DAVOSET
DAVOSET – This tool is used to execute attacks on websites by gaining access through other sites. This method of attack has gained notoriety over time in the hacking space. The structures exploited in this context are often used in website to website interaction. It leverages on the loopholes of XML external entities among other structures.
APACHE BENCHMARK TOOL
APACHE BENCHMARK TOOL – Just as the name implies, it serves as a benchmark for servers (particularly HTTP servers). It is a tool that can be used to monitor your web server statistics in real time. This makes it easily adaptable for Distributed attacks from a single source.
HYENAE
HYENAE – This is also another attack simulation tool. However, it is known to be very versatile and ubiquitous. It could be used to perform different types of DDOS attacks in a simulated environment. This often makes it the ideal tool for carrying out Pen tests



GOLDEN EYE
GOLDEN EYE – This is another tool designed specifically for simulations. It can be used to put the servers in different situations of attempted distributed denial of service. The tester then observes the method of the security system’s response and how to fix the loopholes that present themselves. This tool is designed specifically for servers. It is written for servers as a test tool, but hackers have been able to take advantage and can use it in large scale DDOS attacks.


HPING 3
HPING 3 – This tool can send pretty much any type of protocol packets out to targeted servers. It is even effective in executing a three way server network response attack. It is especially known for showing the response of the targets to an attack situation. Therefore, it would be brilliant for simulations too.
Conclusion
These tools are selected as the top 16 based on their functionality and how popular they are among hackers. There are other tools out there that are dangerous and would be effective in carrying out simulations. As cyber-security personnel, it is beneficial that you know as much of these tools as possible to forestall attacks against your framework security.

8 Best DDoS Attack Tools (Free DDoS Tool Of The Year 2024)
December 21, 2023
The list of the Best free DDoS Attack Tools in the market:
Distributed Denial of Service Attack is the attack that is made on a website or a server to lower the performance intentionally.
Multiple computers are used for this. These multiple computers attack the targeted website or server with the DoS attack. As this attack is performed through a distributed network it is called as Distributed Denial of Service attack.
In simple terms, multiple computers send fake requests to the target in larger quantity. The target is flooded with such requests, thereby the resources become unavailable to legitimate requests or users.

Purpose of DDoS Attack
Generally, the purpose of a DDoS attack is to crash the website.
The duration for which the DDoS attack will last depends on the fact that the attack is on the network layer or application layer. Network layer attack lasts for a maximum of 48 to 49 hours. Application layer attack lasts for a maximum of 60 to 70 days.


DDoS or any other similar kind of attack is illegal as per the Computer Misuse act 1990. As it is illegal, an attacker can get the punishment of imprisonment.

4.Telecommunications: Telecommunication companies are also vulnerable to DDoS attacks. These attacks can disrupt network services, leading to communication outages and potential financial impact.
5.Government and Public Sector: Government agencies and public sector organizations are often targeted by DDoS attacks. These attacks can disrupt online services, compromise data security, and impact public trust.
6.Healthcare: The healthcare industry has seen an increase in cyberattacks, including DDoS attacks. These attacks can disrupt critical healthcare systems, potentially impacting patient care and data security.
It's important to note that DDoS attacks can target any organization, regardless of industry. The motive behind DDoS attacks can vary, including financial gain, political activism, or simply causing disruption. Organizations across all sectors should implement robust cybersecurity measures to mitigate the risks associated with DDoS attacks.


-Can you share any recent trends in DDoS attack targeting?
Recent trends in DDoS attack targeting include:
1.Credential Stuffing Attacks: Hackers are increasingly using credential stuffing attacks, especially targeting video game services. In this type of attack, hackers test a large number of stolen account credentials against a website's login system, potentially increasing traffic volume and causing a similar impact to a DDoS attack 1.
2.Targeting of Gaming Industry: The gaming industry continues to be highly targeted by DDoS attacks. These attacks aim to disrupt game servers, preventing players from accessing popular multiplayer games 2.
3.Increased Attacks on Technology Sector: The technology sector has become the most attacked industry in terms of DDoS incidents. This includes attacks on technology companies, online media, publishing, and broadcasting organizations.
4.Hacktivism and Political Motives: DDoS attacks with political motives, often associated with hacktivism, have been observed. These attacks target websites and online services of governments, political figures, and organizations involved in regional conflicts 2.
5.Application Layer Attacks: There has been a significant increase in application layer attacks, which target the application layer of a network stack. These attacks aim to overwhelm specific functions or services of a website or application, causing disruption.
6.Ransom DDoS Attacks: Threat actors are increasingly using DDoS attacks as a means to pressure victims into paying ransomware attack demands. This tactic has been observed in various groups, including Avaddon, DarkSide, Ragnar Locker, and Sodinokibi 3.
It's important to note that DDoS attack trends can evolve rapidly, and new techniques and targets may emerge over time. Organizations should stay vigilant, implement robust cybersecurity measures, and regularly update their defense strategies to mitigate the risks associated with DDoS attacks.


-What new techniques are attackers using?
Attackers are constantly evolving their techniques to bypass security measures and maximize the impact of their attacks. Here are some new techniques that attackers are using:
1.Social Engineering: Attackers are increasingly relying on social engineering techniques to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. This includes phishing attacks, where attackers send deceptive emails or messages to trick users into clicking on malicious links or providing login credentials.
2.Credential Stuffing: Attackers use stolen username and password combinations from data breaches to launch credential stuffing attacks. They automate the process of trying these stolen credentials on various websites, exploiting users who reuse passwords across multiple platforms.
3.Application Layer Attacks: Attackers are focusing on application layer attacks, targeting vulnerabilities in specific applications or services. These attacks aim to overwhelm the targeted application's resources, causing disruption or denial of service.
4.Advanced Malware: Attackers are developing sophisticated malware, including fileless malware that resides in a device's memory or registry, making it harder to detect and remove. Rootkits are another type of advanced malware that aims to gain unauthorized access to a computer system and mask the presence of other malicious programs 1.
5.Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS): Attackers are leveraging the amplification effect of certain protocols, such as DNS or NTP, to launch DRDoS attacks. By sending small requests to vulnerable servers, attackers can generate a large volume of traffic that overwhelms the target's resources.
6.IoT Botnets: Attackers are increasingly targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices to create botnets. These compromised devices can be used to launch large-scale DDoS attacks, leveraging their collective computing power 2.
It's important for organizations to stay updated on emerging attack techniques and implement robust security measures to mitigate the risks. This includes regular security awareness training for employees, strong access controls, network monitoring, and timely patching of vulnerabilities.


1. 15 Most Common Cyber Attack Types and How to Prevent Them

According to Statista, the average cost of a data breach is around 9.48 million USD, which includes expenses related to discovering and responding to the attack, downtime, lost revenue, and long-term damage to the business’s reputation. It is projected that cybercrime will cost the global economy approximately $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Of course, a large number of security incidents are caused by insiders – whether through negligence or malice.
What is a Cyber Attack?
A cyberattack refers to any deliberate attempt to gain unauthorized access to a network, computer system, or device with the intention of stealing, altering, exposing, or destroying data, applications, or other assets. These attacks are carried out by threat actors who use various strategies such as malware, social engineering, and password theft. It goes without saying that cyberattacks disrupt business operations; however, in some extreme circumstances, they can also lead to their complete destruction.
15 Common Types of Cyber Attacks
While there are many different ways that an attacker can infiltrate an IT system, most cyber-attacks rely on pretty similar techniques. Below are some of the most common types of cyber-attacks:
1.Malware
2.Phishing
3.Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)
4.Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack
5.SQL injection
6.Zero-day exploit
7.DNS Tunnelling
8.Business Email Compromise (BEC)
9.Cryptojacking
10.Drive-by Attack
11.Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
12.Password Attack
13.Eavesdropping attacks
14.Insider Threats
15.IoT-Based Attacks
1. Malware
Malware is unwanted software installed on a system without permission, which can infect computers through legitimate websites, applications, or file attachments. Different types of malware have varying methods of infection, such as replicating, encrypting files, blocking access to data, displaying ads, or collecting information. Malware can include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, keyloggers, botnets, and more. Emotet, for example, is a notorious banking Trojan that has evolved into a sophisticated and polymorphic malware that primarily spreads through phishing emails. Emotet can steal sensitive data, spread across networks, and deliver other malware.
2. Phishing
Phishing is a method used to trick victims into sharing sensitive information or installing malicious files. Sometimes It involves targeted spear phishing, which targets individuals or organizations with deceitful emails. In some cases they high-ranking individuals to steal money or sensitive data. SMiShing and Vishing techniques are sometimes used to entice individuals into revealing personal information through fraudulent text messages, phone calls and voice messages to extract private information. The 2015 attack on Ukraine’s power grid, attributed to Russia, involved sending targeted phishing emails to collect login details and information, leaving many without electricity during the winter.
3. Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)
In a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), an attacker surreptitiously inserts themselves into a communication between two unsuspecting parties. This enables them to potentially eavesdrop on the conversation, extract sensitive information or credentials, or even manipulate the content of the communication. While MITM attacks were once relatively common, the widespread adoption of end-to-end encryption in modern email and chat systems has made them significantly less prevalent.
4. DoS and DDoS Attacks
DoS and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a system or network by overwhelming it with excessive traffic. A DoS attack is carried out by a single attacker, while a DDoS attack involves multiple attacker-controlled machines, often infected with malware, collectively launching the attack. The primary goal of these attacks is disruption, making the targeted system or service unavailable to legitimate users. In some cases, the attacker may gain financial benefits if hired by a competing business. Successful DoS or DDoS attacks can leave the system vulnerable to further attacks. Notable examples include the massive attack on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in February 2020, which is claimed to be the largest publicly disclosed DDoS attack in history.
5. SQL Injection
In the context of SQL databases, SQL injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute SQL statements through an HTML form on a webpage. If the database permissions are not properly configured, the attacker can manipulate the HTML form to perform unauthorized database actions, such as creating, reading, modifying, or deleting data.
6. Zero-day Exploit
A zero-day exploit is a cyberattack where malicious actors exploit a recently discovered vulnerability in widely-used software applications or operating systems before a security patch is released. This allows attackers to target organizations using that software by taking advantage of the vulnerability while it remains unaddressed.
7. DNS Tunnelling
DNS tunneling is a stealthy attack strategy that allows attackers to access targeted systems consistently. Many organizations fail to monitor DNS traffic for suspicious activities, creating opportunities for attackers to include or “tunnel” malicious software into DNS queries. This software establishes a persistent communication channel that is difficult for most firewalls to identify.
8. Business Email Compromise (BEC)
BEC attacks are a type of cybercrime where the attacker targets specific individuals, typically employees with financial authorization, to deceive them into transferring funds into the attacker’s control. BEC attacks require meticulous planning and research, such as gathering information about the organization’s executives, employees, customers, business partners, and potential partners, to effectively convince the victim to release funds. BEC attacks inflict substantial financial losses, rendering them among the most damaging forms of cyber-attacks.
9. Cryptojacking
Cryptojacking involves cybercriminals secretly using a victim’s computer resources, without their knowledge, to mine cryptocurrencies. Organizations often lack visibility into this type of attack, making it challenging to detect and respond. While cryptojacking may not directly result in data theft, it can still lead to significant resource drain and increased energy costs for the affected organization. It’s important for organizations to take appropriate measures to protect their networks and systems from cryptojacking attempts.
10. Drive-by Attack
In a “drive-by-download” attack, an unsuspecting victim stumbles upon a website that surreptitiously infects their device with malicious software. This website can be under the direct control of the attacker or may have been compromised. In some instances, the malware is cunningly embedded within content like banners and advertisements. The prevalence of exploit kits has lowered the barrier to entry for aspiring hackers, enabling them to effortlessly create malicious websites or disseminate harmful content through various channels.
11. Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Aattacks
Cross-site scripting attacks, akin to SQL injection attacks, focus on infecting site visitors rather than extracting database data. An illustration of this is the comments section of a webpage. If user input is not filtered before publishing a comment, an attacker can insert a hidden malicious script. When a user visits the page, the script executes, potentially infecting their device, stealing cookies, or extracting credentials. The attack may also redirect the user to a malicious website.
12. Password Attack
A password attack involves an attacker attempting to predict or discover a user’s password to gain unauthorized access to a device or account. Numerous methods exist for cracking passwords, including Brute-Force, Dictionary, Rainbow Table, Credential Stuffing, Password Spraying, Keylogger, and even Phishing techniques aimed at tricking users into revealing their credentials.
13. Eavesdropping Attacks
Eavesdropping attacks, often called “snooping” or “sniffing,” occur when an attacker looks for network communications that lack security to intercept and access the data being sent across the network. To protect against this, companies often ask employees to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when accessing the company network from public Wi-Fi hotspots, which are not secure.
14. Insider Threats
Insider threats, often consisting of current or previous employees, pose a significant risk to organizations due to their flexible access to the company network, including confidential data and intellectual property. Their understanding of business processes and policies makes it easier for them to carry out malicious activities, such as trading confidential information on the dark web for monetary gain. Of course, not all insider threats are malicious. It’s often the case where users simply send sensitive data to the wrong recipient.
15. IoT-Based Attacks
IoT-based cyber-attacks exploit vulnerabilities in internet-connected devices, such as smart POS, Lighting, and Security systems, to launch denial-of-service, malware and phishing attacks for the purposes of disrupting critical infrastructure, business operations, and obtaining personal data.
How to Prevent Cyber Attacks
Preventing cyber-attacks requires a multi-pronged approach that encompasses a wide range of security solutions. While I won’t discuss the preventative measures for all possible attack vectors, below are some of the most notable ways that businesses can prevent common attack types.
Malware: To prevent malware infections, implement anti-malware and spam protection software, train staff to recognize malicious emails and websites, enforce strong password policies, keep software updated, and control access to systems and data.
Phishing: To prevent phishing attacks, security awareness training is essential to educate employees about suspicious emails and links.
Man-in-the-middle: In the case of MITM attacks, using a VPN is crucial when connecting through public Wi-Fi, being cautious of fake websites, intrusive pop-ups, and invalid certificates.
DoS and DDoS: Preventing DoS and DDoS attacks requires robust network infrastructure with firewalls, traffic filtering, rate limiting, and collaboration with ISPs.
SQL injection/Cross-site scripting: These attacks can be prevented by properly sanitizing inputs and ensuring that special characters entered by users are not rendered on web pages.
Zero-day exploits: Traditional antivirus solutions may not be effective against zero-day exploits, but Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV) solutions can offer some protection.
DNS tunneling: DNS tunneling can be prevented with specialized tools that block malicious DNS queries and blacklist suspicious destinations.
Business Email Compromise: To prevent BEC attacks, employees should be trained to scrutinize emails for fake domains, urgency, and other suspicious elements.
Cryptojacking: Protecting against cryptojacking involves monitoring network device CPU usage and training employees to spot performance issues or suspicious emails.
Drive-by attacks: To minimize drive-by attacks, remove unnecessary browser plug-ins, install ad-blockers, and disable Java and JavaScript when possible.
Password attacks: Preventing password attacks involves strong password policies, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and penetration testing.
Eavesdropping: Eavesdropping attacks can be mitigated by encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit, using firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion prevention solutions, and educating employees about phishing attempts.
Insider threats: To address insider threats, implementing strict access controls, regularly monitoring user behavior, conducting thorough background checks, and educating employees about security risks are essential.
IoT attacks: Protecting against IoT attacks requires changing default router settings, using strong and unique passwords, disconnecting devices when not in use, and keeping them updated with the latest patches.

Distributed Denial Of Service Assaults Are Of Various Types.
These sorts are clarified beneath: 
1.‍Application Layer Attacks 
These kinds of DDoS assaults are very normal, in fact, they are the most well-known sort of DDoS assault. They are geared towards assaulting specific applications, particularly web applications. What aggressors do in this setting is to discover where these applications are powerless. In the wake of finding these provisos, they launch attacks that keep these applications from playing out the administrations they were intended for. As the times progressed, various methods of protecting the PC against application-layer attacks have been created. Notwithstanding, the more old strategies are held under wraps, the more clever the attackers have become. There are various kinds of use layer assaults.

‍Border gateway protocol hijacking – This sort of DDoS attacks are equipped at deflecting the traffic from a target web application to that of the aggressor. In this kind of assault, an aggressor pretends to be another organization by utilizing the prefix of the target organization as their own. That way, the traffic intended to flow towards the organization are directed to where the assailant needs it to. 

‍Jumbo Payload assaults – This kind of application layer assault is designed for making applications useless by sending contents that are excessively enormous. In this assault, a structure of data encoded in XML is sent to the server of the target web application. At the point when this application attempts to decode the data, it utilizes a lot of memory and it crashes from exhausting it.
User Datagram protocol attack – These attacks are often random. Attackers use user datagram protocols to flood random ports on the targeted host. When network hosts are flooded with UDPS, they become unable to respond to the normal users.  Essentially, the network uses the available resources to process the requests from the datagram. By implication, when the normal user intends to access these ports, the user gets a message that it can’t be reached.
‍Mimicked user attack – This type of attack is as straightforward as the name sounds. The attacker uses botnets posed as normal users to access specified applications.  The attacker uses a lot of these botnets and they consequently create a high volume of traffic that overpowers the website in the target. The high volume of traffic created causes the application to cease to render service to the original users.
2.‍Volumetric attacks
‍These attacks are just about as clear as their name suggests; they include assaulting a server, an application, or a network with volume. Basically, aggressors send a tremendous measure of information to the target to cripple it from working. Most aggressors consider volumetric assaults as the least difficult kind of DDoS assaults. In some limit cases, these kinds of assaults even disables the frameworks put up to check DDoS assaults. Essentially, volumetric assailants utilize a lot of information to gobble up the transmission capacity between a web application, server, and network (or the web in general). There are various instances of volumetric DDoS assaults 

Internet Protocol security attacks – These kinds of assaults are explicitly focused on the web protocol security of the target network. They are directed at the resources of the network with the essential objective of depletion. 
Internet protocol fragmentation attacks – In this kind of assault, huge parcels of information (internet protocols) are broken into minute units and are sent across the focus network. At the point when these little units make it effectively into the network, they re-assemble to become an entire datagram. The datagrams in context are frequently higher than the limit of the network. A definitive point of the assault is to take up all the accessible memory of the target network. 
3.‍Reflection attacks
In this sort of assault, the aggressor needs to pretend as (profess to be) the target IP, this is done by imitating this IP address and by additionally by overstating the characteristics of the target network – this is technically termed spoofing. When the attacker successfully does this, messages are sent to the server to request information using protocols. In most cases, the attacks are carried out using user datagram protocols (UDP) or transfer control protocols (TCP). By implication, the server attempts to reply to the voluminous amount of requests from the target address.
In simpler terms, overload of responses is reflected from the attacker’s address towards the target address because the attacker has imitated the target.  In most cases, you can easily spot reflection attacks, they are usually large enough to pique the interest of the network administrator. This is solely because of the size of requests directed to a single port on the network. Reflection DDoS attacks require no special efforts to launch and in very extreme cases may be difficult to prevent. 


Domain Name System (DNS) DDoS Attacks
Think about a Domain name framework as some kind of telephone directory of web destinations. It is an arrangement of naming and recognizing web destinations with their IP address. Or on the other hand, in easier terms, it is somewhat similar to a registry that coordinates with the names of websites with explicit numbers. This catalog of names is appropriated and put away in DNS servers all throughout the planet.
Aside from ID and explicitness, domain name frameworks are likewise methods for web destination security. The significance of domain name frameworks makes them consistent targets of DDoS assaults. At the point when assaults are effectively executed against the domain name system, both the identity and the security of the organization in question to are undermined. There are various instances of assaults coordinated at area name frameworks.
TCP SYN assault – This kind of DDoS assault exploits the strategy of a user-server association called the "three-way handshake". What the attacker does is misuse this strategy and in the process devour such a large number of resources to render the network nonfunctional. Typically, for an association to be made between a user and a server, these three cycles are required:
The user PC sends packets to demand a connection with the worker – this request is made utilizing the SYN 
The server sends affirmation messages to the user PC (SYN-ACK) 
The customers send another message to the server; however, this time around it is an affirmation message (ACK).
The above method of association foundation is known as the "three-way handshake". In a TCP SYN assault, the assailants send demand messages more than once to the target server. In many cases, the assailants do this by utilizing various phony IP addresses. The server attempts to react to various messages that seem genuine and subsequently exhaust its resources. The aftereffect of this is that the server sends "lost connection messages" to normal users. 
DNS amplification attacks – This kind of attack is actually what the name suggests. Attackers do numerous DNS search demands (amplification) to render a network non-functional. The amplification brings about the depletion of the data transfer capacity of the organization. All in all, the attackers structure their requests to be commonly bigger than the size of a normal DNS demand. Therefore, the server is made to send responses bigger than it would have typically done. The fundamental rule of this kind of assault is to exploit the size of the responses.
Typically, DNS demands get responses that are somewhat bigger than the size of the requests. By implication, sending enormous search requests make the server (need to) produce a correspondingly huge response. It doesn't end here; attackers combine this with a reflection DDoS attack. The attackers imitate target IP addresses and reflect the dangerous large responses towards them. Think of it like using a concave mirror to amplify and reflect a little ray of light towards pieces of paper. Just that in the case of DNS amplification attacks, both the network transmission capacity and the target IP may be affected.
Slow-rate DDoS – These types of attacks are slow attacks focused on the hypertext transfer protocol. It is a method where external packets are slowly introduced at a slow and consistent rate. It is oftentimes not distinguishable from normal traffic because of its low speed. These kinds of attacks do not need very elaborate or wide-ranged resources; in other words, they can be launched from a single computer. Some tools employed by attackers include R.U.D.Y and sock stress
HTTP flooding attacks – Just like the slow rate attacks, you can almost not differentiate these attacks from normal traffic. In fact, most times, HTTPS floods are more difficult to detect than slow rate DDoS. What attackers do in this context is to make legitimate requests with a group of computers interconnected by malware. The goal of this method is to make the application attend to many intensive processes at the same time. They are very difficult to detect and defend against because they appear legitimate on the surface.
Ping flood attack – Normally, internet control message protocols (also known as pings) are diagnostic protocols. They are used to run analytics on the health of certain devices and how well they can connect with users. DDoS attackers over flood networks with pings. Consequently, the networks send responses to match the number of ping requests.  Like all other volumetric attacks, the influx of pings makes the traffic inaccessible to other normal users.

Size OF DDOS ATTACK 
DDoS assaults have varying sizes. Generally, a large portion of the DDoS assaults on the web are of moderately little size. This means, regardless of how little the size of an assault is, it is enough to disturbing the progression of traffic on any network today. The viability of these attacks changes with the defensive structures of these networks, servers, or applications. The web has seen some extremely huge DDoS attacks, the biggest of them to be recorded gone between 2.5 terabytes each second to 500 terabytes each second. In any case, there has truly not been a fixed figure of how enormous DDoS assaults can be.
‍
How To Prevent And React To DDoS Attack
Let’s stick with the road and the traffic analogy shall we? If you want to successfully control an overcrowded route, you must be able to distinguish the actual legitimate users from the ones trooping in from other routes. Prevention and reacting to DDoS attacks work like too, though they are way more complex. The initial and most difficult obstacle is to be able to identify which traffic is illegitimate and which is that actual user.
This may be especially difficult in spoofing attacks. In these attacks, attackers blend into the crowd as much as possible, they appear as natural as natural traffic can get. So it is important to first be careful not to get rid of the normal users along with suspected attackers.
Let’s go on a journey on how to prevent these attacks, how to limit the consequent effect of these attacks, and how to bounce back just in time for continued functionality.
1.‍Never be caught Off guard -  Just like in the case of any other attack, anticipating DDoS and setting up a defense plan is very important. Now that you can identify various forms of DDoS attacks, you should prepare immediate response plans to each of those types that are most relevant to your network, service or application. For instance, there are various network defense systems available that you can leverage on. 
2.Continually testing your defense mechanism using DDoS tools – Another method of being battle-ready for DDoS attackers is to continually subject your network to demo DDoS attacks.  These demo attacks help to gauge the efficiency of your security system. It also stimulates a demo response to prepare your security team for such emergencies. There are quite a number of DDoS tools available to carry out these demo tests. Each of these tools functions differently and each provides the users with a different test interface. Here are 10 examples of free DDoS attack tools available today:
Pyloris
DDOSIM – DDO simulator
Low Orbit Ion Canon LOIC
High Orbit Ion Canon (HOIC)
HTTP unbearable Load King (HULK)
Open web application security project (OWASP) HTTP post
Thor’s Hammer
Golden Eye
RUDY (R-U-Dead_Yet)
DAVOSET
3.‍Using a web application firewall – In the instance where your web app is under attack, you may employ a web application firewall (WAF) to reduce the effects of dangerous traffic to the barest minimum. What a firewall does, in this case, is to place a barrier between your application and other suspected traffic flow from attackers. A web application firewall selects between traffic using a predetermined group of instructions. After ascertaining which set of traffic is a potential danger, it blocks them off. This method is particularly effective against a layer 7 DDoS attack.
4.‍Using black hole routes – When too many cars on a route, you could also direct some away towards an empty route. In some instances, you could use an emergency (improvised routes) to lessen traffic flow on the initial route. This is the underlying principle of black hole routing. These black holes are used as some sort of funnel to channel away from the excess flow of traffic on a server, network, or application. When doing these, the best practice is to design your black hole to identify certain criteria for retaining legitimate traffic. Otherwise, both the good flow and the bad ones are sucked into the funnel. 
5.Limiting the rate of requests on your server – This method can both mitigate and prevent DDoS attacks. If made active as a network security protocol, it limits the number of requests your server can receive (irrespective of whether it is from a normal user or from an attacker). This method can be activated in an emergency when you notice there is an attack on your server too. Despite the fact that it has no filter, it is the most effective means of preventing and mitigating attacks. 
6.Network Diffusion – Diffusion – as a concept of science – is the random movement of substances from a region of high concentration to a region of lower concentration till they become evenly distributed.  In the case of DDoS attacks, extremely high traffic flows are redirected into various smaller channels for the purpose of decongestion.  
7.To withstand a DDoS attack, you need to test the system with a load. The IP stresser tool will help you in this

-https://www.wallarm.com/what/how-to-stop-ddos-attacks-with-a-small-budget

On October 21, 2016, the most significant DDoS assault (DNS related) in history happened, cutting down huge organizations like PayPal, Spotify, Twitter, Reddit, and eBay. Some even considered it the DNS Doomsday of the web. As the web keeps developing, it's not astounding that DDoS assaults are on the ascent at an alarming rate. Indeed, as per information gave from easy DNS, DDoS assaults after some time is deteriorating. For a ton of destinations, it may very well involve time until you are hit.

Why DDoS Attacks Are Dangerous For Business
DDoS attacks work by spamming a worker with gigantic quantities of requests that over-burden its ability to meet them. The aftereffect of this is that real traffic can't associate, and the worker is disconnected. It's a genuinely direct strategy for assault and one that should be possible without incredible specialized information - you can even purchase DDoS as an assistance pack on the dark web that will accomplish the work for you. Be that as it may, the effect can be decimating.
Previously, DDoS assaults may have been viewed as, to a greater degree, an irritation than a genuine danger to organizations, yet this is not true anymore. This is an enormous part of the colossal multiplication of effectively hackable Internet of Things gadgets that make it simple to create a vast botnet to flood focused on locales with traffic. Subsequently, assaults can be more extraordinary and last more than any time in recent memory, which means even the most prominent organizations are in danger.
In any case, they keep up their overall effortlessness and can be hard to stop, which implies organizations should have explicit DDoS safeguards in their security technique.

Means Of Protection Against DDoS For A Small Budget
The best means of how to stop DDoS attacks for a small budget is the DIY method. However, DIY security is broadly viewed as a frail way to deal with DDoS moderation. In reasonable terms, it depends on setting static traffic limits (e.g., utilizing mod_evasive) and unpredictable IP boycotting rules. It is, for the most part, liked for budgetary reasons yet hardly considered by online organizations.
If you are searching for affordable means of how to stop DDoS attacks, keep reading to find the cheapest and most reliable means in your budget. By combining a few tricks to reduce the attack surface, you can certainly survive a DDoS attack with a small budget, and we will explain how to do that in a few paragraphs.
1.Ensure to make your server as fast as possible
For a start, your web server should be as fast as possible. In other words, it must be able to answer a request in milliseconds. If you are using an IIS server, the easiest way to achieve this is to enable HTTP Keep-Alive. This will allow your webserver to process multiple requests in parallel using a single connection.
2.Make use of a CDN service
Another way to achieve a high rate of requests per second is to use a CDN service. This is a distributed network of servers that will send your content to the end-user instead of your web server. This way, your web server only needs to deal with requests from the CDN servers.
A CDN service can undoubtedly help you mitigate a DDoS attack with a small budget, but you will still need to implement a few other things to increase your protection level.
Note! Never expose a single IP address to the Internet. There are several ways to achieve this, but the easiest one is to use a reverse proxy.
A reverse proxy server can accept incoming requests and forward them to your web server. The web server will then decide if the reverse proxy server can handle the request or if it needs to be sent to a different server. This way, you can have multiple web servers behind a single IP address or have a single server with multiple IP addresses (VIPs).
3.The use of SSL encryption
Another trick to reduce your attack surface is to use SSL encryption. With SSL, you can secure your web server, the reverse proxy server, and your CDN servers. This way, your attackers are unable to access your network because all your servers use encryption.

Other Ways To Protect
1.On-premise appliances
The on-premise way to deal with DDoS security utilizes hardware appliances conveyed inside an organization before ensuring workers.
As a rule, these kinds of appliances have progressed traffic sifting abilities outfitted with a blend of geo-blocking, rate restriction, IP notoriety, and mark identification of signature.
You can viably use regular mitigation appliances to sift through harmful approaching traffic. This makes them a feasible choice for halting application layer assaults.
2.Off-premise cloud-based solutions
Generally, off-premise solutions are either ISP-gave or cloud-based. While ISPs commonly offer just organization layer assurance, cloud-based solutions give extra separating abilities to stop application layer assaults. Both offer practically boundless adaptability, as they are sent outside of an organization and aren't obliged by the already distinguished uplink limits.
That's it! Using this simple advice, you will block all known techniques for DDOS attacks, and it will force your attackers to use more advanced techniques.

DDoS protection¶
A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker seeks to make a website or online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. This document described recommendations for DDoS protection and methods to protect your resources with Wallarm.
DDoS attacks are often launched from a network of compromised computer systems, often referred to as a botnet. Attackers use these systems to send a large volume of traffic to the target, overloading the server and preventing it from being able to respond to legitimate requests. DDoS attacks can be targeted at any type of online service, including websites, online games, and even social media platforms.
There are many techniques that attackers can use to launch a DDoS attack, and the methods and tools they use can significantly vary. Some attacks are relatively simple and use low-level techniques such as sending large numbers of connection requests to a server, while others are more sophisticated and use complex tactics such as spoofing IP addresses or exploiting vulnerabilities in network infrastructure.
DDoS attack taxonomy¶
There are several types of DDoS attacks that attackers can use to disrupt the availability of a website or online service. Here are the common types of DDoS attacks:



OSI layer / Attack Type	Volumetric and amplification attacks	Protocol exploits and Logic bombs
L3/L4	UDP flood: These attacks send large numbers of UDP packets to a target in an attempt to consume available bandwidth and disrupt service.
ICMP flood (Smurf attacks): These attacks use ICMP to send large numbers of echo request packets (commonly known as "ping" requests) to a target in an attempt to consume bandwidth and disrupt service.	SYN flood: These attacks exploit the way that TCP connections are established. The attacker sends a large number of SYN packets to a target, but never completes the three-way handshake process that is used to establish a connection. This can tie up the resources of the target server, as it waits for the completion of the handshake process.
Ping of Death: These attacks send oversized packets to a target in an attempt to crash it. The packets are larger than the maximum size that the target can process, and the attempt to handle them can cause the target to crash or become unavailable.
L7	HTTP flood: These attacks use a large number of seemingly legitimate GET or POST requests to a server or web application to overwhelm a target. This type of attack is often carried out using botnets, which are networks of compromised computers infected with malware and controlled by the attacker.
Amplification attacks: These attacks leverage the use of amplification techniques to amplify the volume of traffic sent to a target. For example, an attacker might send a small request to a server that responds with a much larger response, effectively amplifying the volume of traffic that is sent to the target. There are several different techniques that attackers can use to launch an amplification attack, including: NTP amplification, DNS amplification, etc.	Slowloris: Slowloris attacks are unique in that they require minimal bandwidth and can be carried out using just one computer. The attack works by initiating multiple concurrent connections to a web server and maintaining them for an extended period of time. The attacker sends partial requests and occasionally complements them with HTTP headers to prevent them from reaching a completion stage.
API/App specific (L7+)	Heavy Request: These attacks use specially crafted requests that lead the server to send a large amount of data in response. This type of attack is commonly used in targeted attacks because it requires a preliminary study of your web application and is based on exploiting its vulnerabilities.	Logic Bomb: These attacks use specially crafted requests that contain a large amount of data and are designed to exploit vulnerabilities during the request processing that lead to large resource consumption on the target systems. There are different types of logic bombs: XML Bomb, JSON Bomb, etc.

Volumetric and amplification attacks seek to overwhelm a target with a large volume of traffic. The goal is to saturate the bandwidth or computing resources of the targeted server or network, making it unable to respond to legitimate requests.
Protocol exploits and Logic bombs are DDoS attacks aimed to exploit vulnerabilities in the way that a service or network communicates. These attacks can disrupt the normal flow of traffic by exploiting certain protocols or by sending malformed packets that are difficult for the target to process.
Mitigation of DDoS attacks¶
Since DDoS attacks can take many different forms and target different OSI layers, single measures are not effective, it is important to use a combination of measures to provide comprehensive protection against DDoS attacks.
Internet Service Providers and Cloud Service Providers usually provide the first line of L3-L4 DDoS attack defense. As for high-severity L3-L4 DDoS attacks, additional mitigation tools are required, e.g.:
The DDoS attack that generates traffic at a rate of 1 Gbps or more may require specialized DDoS protection services for traffic scrubbing. Traffic scrubbing is a technique for routing traffic through a third-party service that filters out all malicious traffic and transfers to your service only legitimate requests. As an additional protection measure against L3-L4 DDoS attacks you can also use the solutions like NGFW.
L7 DDoS attacks, also known as "application layer" attacks, are more targeted and sophisticated than L3-L4 attacks. Typically, L7 DDoS attacks are aimed at peculiarities of attacked applications and they can be difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. For protection against L7 DDoS attacks, use WAF/WAAP or specialized Anti-DDoS solutions that analyze traffic on application layer. It is also recommended to configure the API Gateway or WEB server to be able to handle peak loads.
When choosing protection measures, carefully evaluate the needs and resources of an organization based on the following factors:
Type of attacks
Volume of attacks
Complexity of a web application or API, and costs
It is also necessary to prepare a response plan in order to identify the DDoS attack as soon as possible and take timely countermeasures to mitigate them.
L7 DDoS protection with Wallarm¶
Wallarm provides a wide range of protection measures across L7 DDoS threats:
API Abuse Prevention. Enable the API Abuse Prevention functionality to identify and stop various types of malicious bots.
Brute force trigger to prevent massive number of requests brute-forcing some parameter values, e.g. passwords.
Forced browsing trigger to prevent malicious attempts to detect a web application's hidden resources, namely directories and files.
Geolocation filtering using denylists and graylists. Prevent access to applications and APIs for certain regions distributing attacks.
Block untrusted origins using denylists and graylists. To protect from targeted attacks, it may be helpful to block any untrustworthy origins (Tor, Proxy, VPN) which allow an attacker to hide location and bypass geofilters.
Logic (Data) bomb detection. Wallarm automatically detects and blocks malicious requests containing Zip or XML bomb.
Rate limiting configuration. Specify the maximum number of connections that can be made to a particular API scope. If a request exceeds the defined limit, Wallarm rejects it.
If you are using NGINX-based Wallarm node, it is recommended to configure NGINX to enhance your security across L7 DDoS as follows:
Caching. Configure cache responses to common requests to absorb some of the traffic generated under DDoS attacks and prevent it from reaching your web application or API.
Rate limiting. Create rate limiting rules for incoming requests to restrict the volume of traffic that can be sent to a target web application or API.
Limiting the number of connections. You can prevent resource overuse by setting a limit on the number of connections that can be opened by a single client IP address to a value appropriate for real users.
Closing slow connections. If a connection does not write data frequently enough, it can be closed to prevent it from remaining open for an extended period of time and potentially hindering the server's ability to accept new connections.
See examples of NGINX configuration and other recommendations
If you are using Kong-based Ingress controller with Wallarm services, it is recommended to follow the best practices to secure API Gateway.

An Overview Of Ransom DDoS (RDDoS) Attack
DDoS extortion attacks, also known as ransom distributed denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks, occur when hackers threaten to launch DDoS attacks unless a ransom is paid. The hacker requests payment, which is typically in the form of bitcoin so that the transaction cannot be traced by law enforcement agencies.
RDoS meaning of such assault is the same as that of a standard DDoS attack: to overwhelm a server or network with bogus requests in order to prevent any real traffic from getting through. This can tarnish a company's image, cause disruptions in operations, and even lead to financial losses. However, paying the extortion charge is not advised because there is no assurance that the attackers would cease the attack and the attackers may demand even more money in the future.
When comparing DDoS extortion/RDDoS attacks to ransomware attacks, it's important to note that there are key differences. When malicious software encrypts a company's files, it can't be decrypted until the ransom is paid. The target of a distributed denial of service attack will not be compromised in this type of assault; only network or application traffic will be interrupted.
‍
Reasons Why RDDoS Becomes A Threat Vector
Some of the following factors contribute to the expanding role of RDDoS in cyberattacks.
Assaults now need less effort than spyware installation—installing malware in an organization's IT system demands professional knowledge. Customizing and exploiting software vulnerabilities for the purposes of sabotage or data theft also takes time. DDoS assaults are relatively simple to execute, and botnets can be rented at a low cost.
Assailants can simply carry out attacks using standard online applications—and attackers are increasingly leveraging gadgets with built-in network protocols to augment DDoS strikes. This utilizes few resources. Removing networking technologies like as CoAP, ARMS, and WS-DD might result in a loss of usefulness, profitability, and accessibility.
Extortion approaches become more beneficial to attackers as Bitcoin values rise—when Bitcoin prices climb, RDDoS criminals revise their demand strategy and launch enormous coercion campaigns.
‍
How Do Hackers Launch This Attack?
Numerous DDoS begin with a ransom note that threatens the victim organization. Before sending out the ransom note, some criminals will launch a little attempt to show that they mean business.
In the event that the one attacking perceives a genuine threat and proceeds with the attack anyhow, the following may occur:
The criminal or collective of criminals initiates the flow of assault traffic towards the target. They could employ a personal botnet or a rented DDoS service. Layers 3 and 4 of a network can be the target of a distributed denial-of-service attack, whereas layer 7 can be the target of a more traditional type of attack.
Due to the high volume of attacks, the targeted service or application becomes unresponsive.
The assault continues until the criminal runs out of time, energy, or money, the target successfully defends against it, or the assault is stopped. Methods of mitigating denial of service, such as IP blocking and rate restriction, are only useful for preventing minor disruptions. Most businesses rely on cloud-based DDoS protection services because of their ability to scale up and resist even the largest attacks.
The offender may conduct additional attacks, reiterate their payment demand, or perhaps both.

History Of RDDoS Attacks
Ransomware denial-of-service (DDoS) attackers, like those behind other forms of malware, are always honing and improving their methods. This increases their ability to carry out the threats stated in the ransom letters and the profitability of the attacks themselves.
To conceal their true identities, RDoS attackers may often adopt the identities of well-known APTs like Fancy Bear, the Armada Collective, or the Lazarus Group. In 2020, these groups' attacks were multi-stage and aimed at businesses across a variety of industries. Later in the year, attacks resumed on the same organizations that had not paid the initial ransom demand of 20 BTC. The bad guys were trying to maximize their return on investment by reusing data they had already collected.
Malicious hackers targeted ISPs and cloud computing infrastructure in 2021. It was clear that the attackers had done their homework, as they went for just the most vulnerable systems. It is clear that the cybercriminals behind the RDoS campaigns were making extra efforts to increase the likelihood of a successful attack and ransom payment by resorting to these more focused attacks.
‍
How To React In A RDDoS Attack?
A RDDoS note is a serious threat, but it also buys the recipient company some time to prepare for the attack. If a company receives an RDoS demand, it should take the following measures:
Do Not Pay the Ransom
Paying the ransom offers no assurance that the cybercriminal will not attack regardless. In addition, the cybercriminal may return and threaten other attacks in order to extract additional payments.
Pass the Information Along
RDoS ransom notes are frequently given to random people within an organization who may not know what to do with them. Education of employees is necessary to guarantee that information reaches the appropriate individuals to enable a reaction.
Check for a Demo Assault
Hackers may conduct a demonstration attack prior to the deadline in order to demonstrate their skills. Screening for a simulated attack can aid in identifying if a danger is real and provide valuable threat knowledge for defending against the attack.
Notify Your Security Personnel
Inform your security provider with any accessible details regarding the threat, including the ransom note and any data from a demonstration attack. This enables them to better prepare for the threat's mitigation.
‍
How Do I Prevent A RDDoS Attack?
When an entity gets a RDDoS threat, it should take phases to get ready for the attack and stop it. Among the finest practices are:
Recognize Your Attack Surface
A RDoS attack will likely target Internet-exposed, mission-critical systems, such as a company website or VPN gateway. Recognizing potential targets is a prerequisite for their protection.
Develop a Plan
Planning a reaction during a DDoS attack results in additional minutes of outage. Develop a DDoS response plan in advance to enable rapid attack mitigation.
Implement Complete DDoS Protection
If the cybercriminal cannot effectively launch a DDoS assault against the organization, an RDoS letter is a bluff. Essential to an RDoS prevention plan is the deployment of a comprehensive DDoS protection system from a vendor known to have managed and blocked large-scale DDoS and RDoS attacks.
Examine Ddos Mitigation SLAs
A DDoS protection provider must provide at least six essential SLAs. Prior to an attack, ensure that a vendor's SLAs satisfy business requirements.

RDDoS Attack Vs Ransomware
Security breaches are a prevalent type of online extortion. Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts the systems and databases of an organization, rendering them inoperable. Once the encryption has been completed, the attacker will demand payment to decode the organization's systems. Somehow, ransomware must gain entree to an organization's internal systems or network; infected email attachments coupled with phishing assaults are a popular danger vector.
DDoS ransom attacks, unlike ransomware attacks, do not encrypt a company's systems; instead, they try to knock them offline. In addition, it does not require the attacker to get access to an association’s internal structures. With adequate DDoS protection, a DDoS ransom attack has minimal to no effect on the operation of a firm.
‍

Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs)
1. What is the most powerful DDoS tool?
It is not ethical to determine the most powerful DDoS tool or discuss it here. Such tools are designed to cause harm and disrupt legitimate online services. The use of these tools is illegal and can lead to severe legal consequences.
2. What tools are used for DDoS attacks?
Various tools can be used for DDoS attacks, including LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon), HOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon), Xerxes, and many others. These tools send a large amount of traffic or requests to a target server or website, overwhelming it and causing it to become unavailable.
3. What is the most successful DDoS attack?
I cannot provide information on the most successful DDoS attack as such attacks are illegal and can cause severe damage to the target's online presence. It is important to note that engaging in such activities is unethical, and it is crucial to respect the laws and regulations governing online activities.
4. Are DDoS attacks profitable?
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are not considered profitable for the attacker as they do not directly generate any revenue.
The primary goal of DDoS attacks is to disrupt the targeted website or service and cause damage to the organization's reputation or financial losses. In some cases, attackers may use DDoS attacks as a smokescreen to carry out other malicious activities, such as data theft, extortion, or other types of cybercrime.
5. Are DDoS attacks easy?
DDoS attacks are not considered easy to carry out. They require a significant amount of resources, technical skills, and coordination. DDoS attacks typically involve a large number of compromised devices, such as computers, smartphones, or IoT devices, that are controlled by the attacker through malware or botnets.
These attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world, making it challenging to track down the attacker's location. Additionally, the defender may use various security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and content delivery networks (CDNs), to mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks.

Why do we recommend it?
Sucuri Website Firewall is a major competitor to our top pick, Indusface AppTrana. This is a cloud-based edge service that doesn’t need to be hosted or maintained but instead, diverts all traffic on the way to a Web asset and filters out attacks. The protected system only receives the valid traffic and the value of the Sucuri service is its ability to tell the difference between malicious and genuine traffic.
For additional protection Sucuri Website Firewall uses geo-blocking. Geo-blocking blocks visitors to your site from the top three countries with DDoS attacks. However, if you want to control access to a smaller degree you can white list IP addresses that you trust so that you can communicate with your team without them being blocked.
There are four versions of Sucuri Website Firewall available to purchase: Basic, Pro, Business, and Custom Solutions. The Basic version starts at $9.99 (£8.19) per month. The Pro version starts at $19.98 (£16.39) per month with SSL certificate support.
Who is it recommended for?
The potential market for Sucuri Website Firewall is the same as that for Indusface AppTrana. The two tools work in a very similar way and each acts as a proxy server, receiving all traffic on behalf of the protected website. So, you don’t need to dedicate any specialist cybersecurity staff to managing your site’s protection. An important difference between these two services is that the Sucuri system is significantly cheaper and so it is more likely to appeal to small businesses.
Pros:
Ideal solution for environments needing to protect their applications and testing environments
Uses simple rules and templates to start mitigating/preventing DDoS attacks right away
Users can block by IP, geolocation, traffic type, and behavior
Works well in both medium and large environments – flexible pricing
Cons:
VIP support requires the Business Platform pricing tier
The Business version costs $69.93 (£57.35) per month with additional features. The Custom Solutions are customizable packages on their website where you can chat to an online assistant and learn more.

4. StackPath Web Application Firewall (FREE TRIAL)

StackPath is a DDoS protection solution and Web Application Firewall designed to protect against cybercriminals. StackPath provides layers 3, 4, and 7 protection. At layer 7 the solution uses behavioral algorithms to detect and block volumetric attacks at the application layer. The mitigation capabilities of the program include attacks such as HTTP, UDP, and SYN floods.
Key Features
DDoS protection
Web application firewall
Network, Transport, and Application Layer protection
CDN available
Why do we recommend it?
StackPath Web Application Firewall is a cloud-hosted proxy system that receives all traffic intended for a public IP address, filters out threats, and then forwards the genuine traffic. This edge service will also act as a caching system and content delivery network. That means Web browsers requesting a page on a site can actually get the code from a StackPath server, lightening the load on the protected server. The CDN stores a copy of a site on a number of servers around the world to shorten the delivery path to different parts of the world.
To address larger attacks, StackPath has a capacity of 65 Tbps (higher than the largest DDoS attack on record). The available capacity provides resistance against even the strongest attacks. StackPath is also capable of blocking attacks from anywhere in the world through its network of edge locations.
To protect your applications from being compromised, the Web Application Firewall can be configured with DDoS thresholds. You can configure DDoS thresholds to determine when the DDoS engine will respond to an attack. For example, if the domain threshold or burst threshold exceeds a predefined number of requests.
Who is it recommended for?
StackPath Web Application Firewall is similarly priced to the Sucuri package, which means that these two systems compete closely to attract small businesses. The combination of Web application protection with content delivery optimization means that this is a good deal.
Pros:
Leverages behavioral machine learning to detect new forms of DDoS attacks
Offers 35+ edge locations worldwide
Supports blocking application-layer attacks
Edge locations allow your content to remain accessible even while under attack
Cons:
Would like to see the option for a trial download
There are many pricing options available for StackPath but the two most relevant Individual Services are the CDN package and the WAF package. The CDN package costs $10 (£8.21) per month for network layer DDoS protection. The WAF package also costs $10 (£8.21) for network layer DDoS protection and application layer DDoS protection. You can download the free trial.

5. Link11

Link11 is a cloud-based DDoS protection tool. The system can detect and mitigate web and infrastructure DDoS attacks through layers 3-7 in real-time. The software uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect an attack.
Key Features
DDoS absorption
Protection at Network, Transport, and Application Layers
AI processes
Why do we recommend it?
Link11 is a specialized DDoS protection system rather than a feature of a wider Web application firewall or edge service bundle. The system is highly regarded and quickly spots DDoS attacks. The ability to perform at speed and accurately identify malicious traffic can make or break a DDoS protection system because no one wants genuine traffic to be held up or blocked. Link11 uses AI to sharpen its DDoS blocking service.
The AI analyzes the sequences of known-attack patterns and uses this data to compare with live usage. If a connection to the network is behaving the same way as a potential attacker the platform can respond immediately with a notification via SMS once a threat is detected.
In terms of setup, Link11 is very easy to deploy because it is run in the cloud. You don’t need to set up additional hardware and in a matter of minutes, you can configure the platform to protect your network infrastructure from an attack. The monitoring dashboard provides you with a centralized view of traffic, application and server behavior protection service can detect and mitigate attacks. Easy to deploy, uses AI and dashboard gives good view of server behavior.ior so you can see what’s going on.
There is also a reporting feature so you can generate reports on security events. The program enables you to schedule reports or generate them manually depending on your needs.
Who is it recommended for?
Link11 is a good choice for a large business that is dependent on the availability of its websites to maintain profitability. There are two aspects to this package that will put small businesses off. The first is that rival systems combine DDoS protection with other services, such as a content delivery service, which provides all of the edge services that a website needs. The other detraction is that Link11 doesn’t publish a price list and you can’t just sign up through an automated online process.
Pros:
Cloud-based DDoS protection – simple setup, no need to invest in new hardware
Uses AI to spot new forms of DDoS attacks
Preconfigured dashboards make it easy to gain new insights
Cons:
More suited towards enterprise environments – not the best fit for small businesses
No on-premise option is available
Link11 is one of the most widely-used DDOS protection platforms on this list because it combines simplicity with top-notch automation. The AI is excellent at navigating the latest threats. If you’d like to view the price of Link11 you will have to contact the company directly. You can request a trial version.
6. Cloudflare

Cloudflare is a high-performance DDoS protection service that has a network capacity of 30 Tbps, 15x that of the largest DDoS attack ever recorded. The high capacity makes Cloudflare resistant to even the most powerful attacks. To keep up with new forms of attack the software uses an IP reputation database which blocks new threats across 20 million different properties.
Key Features
Free tier
DDoS protection
CDN included
Why do we recommend it?
Cloudflare just about invented the modern DDoS service and that makes this a very difficult service to beat. The company has massive capacity to absorb very large traffic floods and that also makes it the first choice for many businesses. Since its inception as a DDoS protection service, Cloudflare has expanded into other edge services and can combine DDoS protection with content delivery, failover protection, and malware protection.
The defenses of Cloudflare have been designed to cover a range of DDoS and data breach attacks. For example, the product uses rate limiting to block network visitors with unusually high request rates. Likewise, it uses a Content Delivery Network or CDN to ensure the network stays available. The CDN is supported by 193 data centers across 90 countries.
There are four different versions of Cloudflare; Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise. The Free version doesn’t cost anchoring for individuals with a personal website. The Pro version costs $20 (£16) per month with a Web Application Firewall designed for professional websites, blogs, and portfolios.
Who is it recommended for?
Cloudflare is appealing to any business that runs a website. The company has created a Free plan, which includes many other edge services. So, this is probably the natural number-one choice for startups and small businesses. The vast capacity of this system to absorb attacks will also appeal to very large organizations that are regularly subject to DDoS attacks.
Pros:
Is known in the industry for mitigating some of the largest DDoS attacks recorded
Has a wide array of edge locations to keep content accessible during an attack
Offers numerous packages – suitable for different size environments
Cons:
Setup can have a steeper learning curve than competing products
Would like to see more performance insights, even when no attacks are detected
The Business version costs $200 (£164) per month with the option to use custom WAF rules, 100% uptime SLA and the fastest speed. The Enterprise version is a customizable package with a named solution engineer and is priced on a case-by-case basis. You can check out their pricing plans or download the free trial version.
7. AWS Shield

AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection solution that uses flow monitoring to analyze incoming traffic. By monitoring flow data AWS Shield can detect malicious traffic in real-time. The solution also uses other defense measures like packet filtering and prioritizing traffic to control the management of traffic in the network.
Key Features
Packet filtering
DDoS blocking
Load balancing
Why do we recommend it?
AWS Shield is available in a number of editions that offer increasingly more complicated services and capabilities. However, the basic package is enough for those seeking DDoS protection and that edition is free to use. The higher plans enable experienced cybersecurity experts to write their own firewall rules and there is also an option to get automated responses implemented.
You can also write rules with AWS WAF to defend against application-layer attacks. For more advanced protection there is AWS Shield Advanced. AWS Shield Advanced uses mitigation capacity to minimize the effect of larger DDoS attacks. There is also a dedicated response team on hand to assist with manual mitigations for more complex attacks.
There are two main versions of AWS Shield available on the market: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced. AWS Shield Standard is free and provides protection against common network and transport DDoS attacks.
Who is it recommended for?
AWS Shield is certainly designed as a strong rival to Cloudflare. Its free tier is a great marketing advantage when pitching for small business customers. However, there is one attribute of the AWS Shield that limits its appeal. That is, this system is only designed to protect AWS accounts, such as the EC2 system. The paid plans are quite expensive and they are suitable for large enterprises.
Pros:
Designed specifically for AWS cloud environments
AWS customers can access AWS Shield from their existing AWS products
Offers a centralized solution to protect AWS assets
Cons:
Setup can be complex, requiring knowledge of AWS architecture
Designed specifically for AWS – not the best option for non-AWS customers
AWS Shield Advanced includes additional defense features for Amazon Elastic Compute, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Elastic Load Balancing. AWS Shield Advanced costs $3,000 (£2,460) per month plus additional usage fees. You can get started with AWS Shield here.
8. Akamai Prolexic Routed

Akamai Prolexic Routed is a managed DDoS security service that can block DDoS attacks such as UDP floods, SYN floods, HTTP GET, and POST floods. Akamai Prolexic Routed has zero-second mitigation so that threats are spotted the moment they occur. However, if you require more support you have the assistance of the Security Operations Center to fall back on 24/7.
Key Features
DDoS absorption
Attack analysis
System hardening
Why do we recommend it?
Akamai Prolexic Routed is a cloud service that is provided by one of the leading cybersecurity firms in the world. The reputation of Akamai is itself enough to get this product on our list. However, Akamai doesn’t rest on its laurels and provides a very powerful DDoS protection service that rapidly scans all incoming traffic at a rate of 400 Gbps. The speed of the Akamai system and its global distribution in 16 centers around the world provide this service with its ability to compete with Cloudflare.
Network traffic monitoring is another feature that Akamai Prolexic Routed uses to catch attacks early on. You can view real-time traffic data through the dashboard. You can also fall back on the 8.0 Tbps of bandwidth supplied by Akamai’s global network with 19 distributed scrubbing centers distributed across the world.
Who is it recommended for?
The Akamai service is aimed at big businesses and doesn’t offer a free tier, which shows that the company realizes that Cloudflare is unbeatable in that sector. Akamai doesn’t publish a price list, which is another reason that small businesses probably won’t go for this service.
Pros:
Block multiple types of DDoS attacks such as SYN, UDP, and POST floods
Offers advanced insights after an attempted attack to help improve security posture
Can automatically reduce attack surfaces before an attack
Cons:
Would like to see a free downloadable trial
Smaller networks may not use features such as hybrid cloud protection
Overall, if you’re in search of a high-performance managed DDoS protection service then Akamai Prolexic Routed is worth a look. If you want to view the pricing for Akamai Prolexic Routed then you will have to contact the sales team directly. You can start a free trial here.
Protect Yourself with a DDoS Protection Service
It only takes one attack to put your network offline and cost you thousands or tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage.
Whether you choose to use an in-house product like SolarWinds Security Event Manager or a managed DDoS protection service like Akamai Prolexic Routed, it is important to be aware of what online services you’re protecting.
For example, if you want to protect your website then a website application firewall like Sucuri Website Firewall is likely to be your best choice. Remember that not all DDoS attacks are the same, and attackers look to strike your defenses where you least expect it.

DDoS Protection FAQs
Do VPNs protect you from DDoS attacks?
Yes. A VPN will protect you against DDoS attacks in two ways. First, it hides the real address of your device – all traffic goes to the VPN rather than directly to you. Secondly, the VPN has a great deal of connection capacity and so is able to absorb the volumes of traffic that would overwhelm your computer. Get a VPN service with a static IP address if you expect incoming connections.
How long can a DDoS attack last?
Commercial DDoS services offer attack durations for as little as 5 minutes. Hardcore hacker-team DDoS attacks can last 24 hours or even as long as 72 hours.
How long does it take to recover from a DDoS attack?
DDoS attacks don’t cause any physical damage, they just block legitimate users from getting access to your site or service. Technical recovery is immediate because as soon as the fake connection requests stop, legitimate requests will get through. Reputation damage can take a long time to recover from.
Can you reverse a DDoS?
In theory, you can DDoS back to an address that DDoSed you. However, there isn’t much point in doing that because the computer that attacked you is just infected by a bot. You won’t get to the real attacker. Also, a botnet that runs an attack can contain hundreds of thousands of computers so you would tie up your own resources for a long time in revenge attacks on all of them.

What are DoS and DDoS attacks?
Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal operations of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of Internet traffic.

DoS attacks accomplish this disruption by sending malicious traffic from a single machine — typically a computer. They can be very simple; a basic ping flood attack can be accomplished by sending more ICMP (ping) requests to a targeted server than it is able to process and respond to efficiently.

DDoS attacks, meanwhile, use more than one machine to send malicious traffic to their target. Often, these machines are part of a botnet — a collection of computers or other devices that have been infected with malware and can thus be controlled remotely by an individual attacker. In other circumstances, multiple individual attackers launch DDoS attacks by working together to send traffic from their individual computers.

DDoS attacks are more prevalent and damaging in the modern Internet for two reasons. First, modern security tools have evolved to stop some ordinary DoS attacks. Second, DDoS attack tools have become relatively cheap and easy to operate.

How are DoS/DDoS attack tools categorized?
A number of tools exist that can be adapted to launch DoS/DDoS attacks, or are explicitly designed for that purpose. The former category are often ““stressors”” — tools with the stated purpose of helping security researchers and network engineers perform stress tests against their own networks, but which can also be used to perform genuine attacks.

Some are specialized and only focus on a particular layer of the OSI model, while others are designed to allow for multiple attack vectors. Categories of attack tools include:

Low and slow attack tools
As the name implies, these types of attack tools use a low volume of data and operate very slowly. Designed to send small amounts of data across multiple connections in order to keep ports on a targeted server open as long as possible, these tools continue to take up the server's resources until it is unable to maintain additional connections. Uniquely, low and slow attacks may at times be effective even when not using a distributed system such as a botnet and are commonly used by a single machine.

Application layer (L7) attack tools
These tools target layer 7 of the OSI model, where Internet-based requests such as HTTP occur. Using an HTTP flood attack to overwhelm a target with HTTP GET and POST requests, a malicious actor can launch attack traffic that is difficult to distinguish from normal requests made by actual visitors.

Protocol and transport layer (L3/L4) attack tools
Going further down the protocol stack, these tools utilize protocols like UDP to send large volumes of traffic to a targeted server, such as during a UDP flood. While often ineffective individually, these attacks are typically found in the form of DDoS attacks where the benefit of additional attacking machines increases the effect.

What are commonly used DoS/DDoS attack tools?
Some commonly used tools include:

Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)
The LOIC is an open-source stress testing application. It allows for both TCP and UDP protocol layer attacks to be carried out using a user-friendly WYSIWYG interface. Due to the popularity of the original tool, derivatives have been created that allow attacks to be launched using a web browser.

High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC)
This attack tool was created to replace the LOIC by expanding its capabilities and adding customizations. Using the HTTP protocol, the HOIC is able to launch targeted attacks that are difficult to mitigate. The software is designed to have a minimum of 50 people working together in a coordinated attack effort.

Slowloris
Slowloris is an application designed to instigate a low and slow attack on a targeted server. It needs a relatively limited amount of resources in order to create a damaging effect.

R.U.D.Y (R-U-Dead-Yet)
R.U.D.Y. is another low and slow attack tool designed to allow the user to easily launch attacks using a simple point-and-click interface. By opening multiple HTTP POST requests and then keeping those connections open as long as possible, the attack aims to slowly overwhelm the targeted server.

How can I defend against DoS/DDoS tools?
Since DoS and DDoS attacks take a variety of forms, mitigating them requires a variety of tactics. Common tactics for stopping DDoS attacks include:

Rate limiting: Limiting the number of requests a server will accept over a certain time window
Web application firewalls: Tools that filter web traffic based on a series of rules
Anycast network diffusion: Placing a large, distributed cloud network between a server and incoming traffic, providing additional computing resources with which to respond to requests.
Cloudflare applies all of these strategies and more to defend against the largest, most complex DoS and DDoS attacks. Learn more about Cloudflare's DDoS protection and how it works.

How to DDoS Like an Ethical Hacker






-https://www.radware.com/security/ddos-threats-attacks/ddos-attack-types/ddos-attacks-on-network-resources/

Seven DDoS Attacks Targeting Network Resources
Attacks that target network resources use a large volume of illegitimate traffic to try to consume, or flood, all of a victim's network bandwidth.
In a typical flooding attack, the offense is distributed among an army of thousands of volunteered or compromised computers - a botnet - that sends a huge amount of traffic to the targeted site, overwhelming its network.
Amplification Attacks
An amplification attack takes advantage of a disparity between a request and a reply in technical communication. For instance, the attacker could use a router as an amplifier, taking advantage of the router's broadcast IP address feature to send messages to multiple IP addresses in which the source IP is spoofed to the target IP. Famous examples of amplification attacks include Smurf attacks (ICMP amplification) and Fraggle attacks (UDP amplification). Another example of a type of amplification attack is DNS amplification, in which an attacker, having previously compromised a recursive DNS name server to cache a large file, sends a query directly or asks for the large cached file. The return message, significantly amplified in size from the original request, is then sent to the victim's spoofed IP address, causing a denial of service condition.
Reflective Attacks
An attack is reflective when the attacker uses a potentially legitimate third party to send the attack traffic, ultimately concealing the attacker's identity.
Connection-Oriented DDoS Attacks
A connection-oriented attack is one in which the attacker must first establish a connection prior to launching a DDoS attack. This type of attack usually affects server or web application security and resources. Examples include TCP and HTTP-based attacks.
Connectionless DDoS Attacks
A connectionless attack does not require the attacker to open a complete connection to the victim and is therefore much easier to launch. A connectionless attack affects network resources, causing denial of service before malicious packets can even reach the server. Examples include UDP floods, ICMP floods, and IGMP floods.
UDP Flood Attacks
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that uses datagrams embed in IP packets for communication without needing to create a session between two devices (it requires no handshake process).
A UDP flood attack does not exploit a specific vulnerability. Instead, it simply abuses normal behavior at a high enough level to cause congestion for a targeted network. It sends a large number of UDP datagrams from potentially spoofed IP addresses to random ports on a target server. The server receiving this traffic is unable to process every request and consumes all of its bandwidth attempting to send ICMP "destination unreachable" packet replies to confirm that no application was listening on the targeted ports. As a volumetric attack, a UDP flood is measured in Mbps (bandwidth) and PPS (packets per second).
ICMP Flood Attacks
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a connectionless protocol used for IP operations, diagnostics, and errors. An ICMP flood, or Ping flood, is a non-vulnerability based attack that does not rely on any specific vulnerability to achieve denial of service, making it difficult to prevent DDoS attacks. An ICMP flood can involve any type of ICMP message, such as a ping request. Once enough ICMP traffic is sent to a target server, the server becomes overwhelmed from attempting to process every request, resulting in a denial of service condition. An ICMP flood is a volumetric attack, measured in Mbps (bandwidth) and PPS (packets per second).
IGMP Flood Attacks
Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a connectionless protocol used by IP hosts to report or leave multicast group memberships for adjacent routers. An IGMP flood is non-vulnerability based, as IGMP is designed to allow multicast. Such floods involve a large number of IGMP message reports being sent to a network or router, significantly slowing and eventually preventing legitimate traffic from being transmitted across the target network.
Protecting Against DDoS Network Attacks
During the seven network flood attacks described above, legitimate users trying to access a site will find the attacked site incredibly slow or unresponsive. These network flood attacks are simple, yet extremely effective, meaning that they require sophisticated DDoS mitigation and DDoS protection solutions.

Table of Contents
What Is A Ping (ICMP) Flood Attack?
How Does A Ping Flood Attack Work?
How Is A Ping Flood Attack Mitigated?
What Is A Ping (ICMP) Flood Attack?
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping requests are used to check for connectivity and the health of networking devices.
In a legitimate ICMP ping, the recipient device replies to an ICMP echo request. The response indicates the health of the recipient.
Ping flood attack, commonly called ICMP flood attack, is a form of DDoS attack in which an attacker floods the recipient device by overwhelming it with ICMP echo requests, also known as pings.
How Does A Ping Flood Attack Work?
To execute a Ping flood attack, the attacker must know the IP address of the recipient device.
For a successful and sustained Ping flood attack, the attacker must have more network bandwidth than the target network. In order to make it viable to overwhelm a target system, attackers generally use botnets.
In a Ping flood attack, the recipient device, whose IP address is targeted, is flooded with ICMP echo requests. There is an expectation that the recipient device will reply to an ICMP echo request.
To make the target device unreachable and unable to respond to legitimate requests, the attacker floods the target device continuously.
How Is A Ping Flood Attack Mitigated?
It is advisable to monitor the ICMP ping requests on a target device. The target network may implement volume and rate limits to prevent Ping flood attack.
Since a Ping flood attack requires a valid IP address to target, secure internal networks using firewalls.
In cases of sudden peaks in requests limit the number of ICMP messages and ping requests. Newer approaches block attacks without impacting legitimate traffic by using machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes legitimate behavior profile and then automatically block malicious attacks. This increases protection accuracy while minimizing false positives

Preemptive Multi-Layered DDoS Protection


-https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/application-security/zero-day-attack/

Zero-day Attack



A zero-day attack (also referred to as Day Zero) is an attack that exploits a potentially serious hardware, firmware, or software security weakness that the vendor or developer may be unaware of. Until mitigated, hackers can exploit the zero-day attack vulnerability to adversely affect programs, data, IoT devices or a network.
The term zero-day is applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed the hacking, and to the number of days the vendor has had to fix them. A zero-day attack gets its name from the number of days the software developer has known about the problem. Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability, they develop patches or advise workarounds to mitigate it.







-https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/application-security/application-layer-ddos-layer-7/

What are Layer 7 DDoS Attacks?
Application layer DDoS attacks, also known as Layer 7 DDoS attacks, are dangerous and sophisticated tools used to attack user-facing applications and networks. These malicious attacks target application layer protocols such as HTTP and DNS, often with the intention of disrupting services or hijacking application protocols. Because application layer attacks focus on the application layer, they can go undetected by traditional defense systems while still taking down websites or networks. Common attack techniques include request floods, application vulnerability exploitation, application-specific attacks such as XML-RPC floods, and zero-day vulnerability exploitation. Protecting user facing applications or networks from these application layer attacks should be a priority for any organization looking to stay secure in the digital space!

How do application layer attacks work?
Application Layer attacks are a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targets application-layer services such as web servers and application firewalls. Such an attack can lead to website service disruption, or even complete website shutdown. An application layer attack takes advantage of the communication protocols used to exchange data between two applications running over the internet. It generally requires fewer resources to mount a successful application layer attack compared to other DDoS attack types since it causes more damage due to its customized nature aimed at specific services or protocols for example HTTP, SMTP or FTP. This makes application layer attacks a common tactic for disrupting critical services, and firms that are serious about protecting their online presence should invest in robust application layer threat mitigation solutions.
What are the different types of Application Layer DDoS Attacks
Application Layer (Layer 7) DDoS Attacks have become an increasingly important concern for businesses, as they can easily overload application servers and cause services to be unavailable. They are more difficult to detect than other DDoS attack types since application layer attacks mimic real user behavior and blend in with regular application use. These attacks can range from subtle application slowdown to full application shut down and come in many forms, such as
TCP SYN Floods
Slowloris Attacks
HTTP Floods
Bandwidth Exhaustion Attacks
DNS Reflection/Amplification Attacks
Web DDoS Tsunami Attack
All of these different kinds of application layer 7 DDoS attacks can have devastating impacts on system availability if preventive measures are not taken, so it is important for businesses to be aware of the various attack types and how they may affect operations.
Layer 7 DDoS Attack Mitigation
Protecting your website or application from a DDoS attack is an increasingly important need in today’s digital world. Layer 7 DDoS attacks are particularly damaging because they target the application layer of your website with malicious requests to overwhelm your servers and cause a denial of service or disruption. There are several steps organizations can take to mitigate against Layer 7 attacks:
Increase webserver connection limits: This can help reduce vulnerability to connection-based attacks such as Slowloris since it reduces the maximum number of open connections that an attacker needs to maintain control over resources on the target webserver.
Implement rate limiting: Rate limiting involves restricting incoming requests from any given IP address in order to prevent DDoS attacks such as those launched by Slowloris attackers. It is essential for organizations to regularly monitor their networks for traffic abnormalities that could indicate malicious activity and take immediate action if necessary.
Use load balancers and web application firewalls (WAFs): WAFs help protect against application layer DDoS attacks by identifying and blocking malicious traffic before it reaches your network or applications. They also provide logs which organizations can review to identify any potential threats or anomalies quickly and act accordingly. Load balancers and reverse proxies can buffer connection and implement multiple connection management techniques to prevent incomplete HTTP requests from affecting application and web servers.
Organizations should also consider using services such as cloud-based DDoS protection or botnet tracking solutions in order to identify suspicious activity quickly and respond appropriately.
Additionally, security best practices such as keeping software updated and patching vulnerabilities regularly should be followed in order to minimize risk and protect against all types of threats, including those posed by malicious actors who use techniques like Slowloris DDoS attacks.
Radware DDoS protection (DefensePro, Cloud DDoS Protection Service), WAF (AppWall and Cloud WAF) and application delivery (Alteon with integrated WAF) solutions mitigate application layer (layer 7) attacks by using approaches that block attacks without impacting legitimate traffic. By using machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms, Radware can understand what constitutes a legitimate behavior profile and then automatically block malicious attacks, while managing user connections effectively without impacting legitimate HTTP requests. This increases protection accuracy while minimizing false positives and disruption to legitimate users.
What to do under an Application Layer (Layer 7) DDoS Attack
A DDoS attack on your website or application can be a serious disruption, compromising the stability and performance of the system, leading to downtime and impacting user experience. If you detect an Application Layer (Layer 7) attack is affecting your website or application it is essential to take action quickly to limit the effect of the attack. An initial response includes taking the system offline if needed to prevent further disruption, using security systems such as WAFs (Web Application Firewalls) to help mitigate attacks, and seeking technical advice from experts in DDoS protection and online security. Being proactive with strong security configuration and methods can also help deflect potential malicious attacks. Taking these steps will help protect your website or application while restoring normal levels of service in a timely manner.
Conclusion
Application layer or Layer 7 DDoS attacks are among the most sophisticated and powerful types of attacks that can be launched against a website or application. These attacks work by overwhelming the target with requests that appear to come from genuine users, thereby preventing legitimate traffic from getting through. There are several different types of application layer attacks, each of which has its own unique characteristics. Radware's behavioral-based detection engine is able to detect and defend against all known types of application layer attacks. Contact Radware today for best-in-class protection against DDoS attacks of all kinds.

What is a TCP SYN Flood DDoS Attack?
What Is A TCP SYN Flood Attack?
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses a three-way handshake between a sender and the receiver to establish a reliable TCP connection between them.
oFirst, the sender that wants to establish a connection with the receiver sends a data segment to the receiver with a Synchronize Sequence Number (SYN) to inform the receiver that the sender wants to initiate a communication and includes the sequence number it will begin.
oThe receiver responds to the sender’s request with SYN-ACK signal bits set. The ACK in the SYN-ACK signifies the acknowledgement response to the segment the receiver received.
oIn the final part of the TCP three-way handshake, the sender acknowledges (ACK) the response of the receiver and they both establish a reliable connection on which they will start the actual data transfer.
An attacker may use a technique called TCP SYN flood to launch a DDoS attack to exhaust the receiver’s resources.
The objective of a TCP SYN flood is to exhaust the receiver resources - that keep track of various states of client or sender connection - in the network and application infrastructure such as firewalls, IPS, load balancers and application servers.
How Does A TCP Flood Attack Work?
TCP SYN Flood attack may use spoofing the IP address in the ACK response in the three-way TCP protocol handshake - SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK. The attack may also be from a malicious sender that intentionally doesn’t send the final ACK. This type of attack may also be done through botnets.
By spoofing the ACK response, the receiver never receives a completed TCP handshake - the final part of the three-way communication - and may be left holding allocated resources.
How Is A SYN Flood Attack Mitigated?
Since the objective is to consume resources of stateful devices that need to maintain information and state of each of the client connection, you need a way to minimize allocated resources as close to completion of the three-way handshake.
Some of the techniques used to mitigate against TCP SYN Flood attack include:
oRate limiting connection requests that can be served by the receiver
oImplementing backlog of connection requests
oUniquely identifying connection requests using SYN cookies
oRecycling oldest half open client connections
oImplementing timeout on how long to keep half open TCP connection requests
There are many solutions to prevent DDoS attacks using TCP SYN flood against the stateful Many IDS, IPS, firewalls, DDoS protection, load balancers and application servers now include above mentioned measures to detect and protect against these attacks.
These protection measures may be deployed as an appliance in your data center, as a cloud-based scrubbing service, or as a hybrid solution combining a hardware device and a cloud service.
Newer approaches block attacks without impacting legitimate traffic by using machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes legitimate behavior profile and then automatically block malicious attacks. This increases protection accuracy while minimizing false positives.

What Is IP Address Spoofing In DDOS
What Is Spoofing
Spoofing refers to altering an address to impersonate someone else. The spoofing may be used to launch DDoS attacks in Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and in the Domain Name System (DNS).
What Is IP Address Spoofing
The Internet Protocol (IP) protocol header includes the source IP address of the sender of the data packet. The source IP address may be altered to disguise an attacker’s origin IP.
IP Address Spoofing In DDoS Attacks
In an IP address spoofing DDoS attack, the attacker modifies the source IP address of the data packet to disguise an attacker’s origin IP.
A botnet is a collection of infected or compromised bots that are geographically distributed. These botnets may be remotely instructed to launch DDoS attacks. The IP address modification is used to mask the identity and location of the compromised and malware infected bots.
The IP address spoofing may also be used to launch a reflected DDoS attack. In a reflected DDoS attack, the attacker sends altered source IP to DNS resolvers, NTP servers and intermediary servers to generate fake requests. The objective of the reflected attack is to amplify the output responses from a few requests using techniques such as DNS amplification, Smurf attack or NTP amplification.
IP address spoofing may also be used to attack application server resources. This is done by spoofing the IP address in the ACK response in the three-way TCP protocol handshake - SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK. By spoofing the ACK response, the receiver server never receives a completed TCP handshake and may be left holding allocated resources.
Anti-Spoofing In DDoS Protection
There are many solutions to prevent DDoS attacks using IP spoofing. Intrusion detection system (IDS), dedicated DDoS protection measures along with Web API and Application Protection (WAAP) will provide the widest coverage against DDoS attacks both against the network as well as against applications. These protection measures may be deployed as an appliance in your data center, as a cloud-based scrubbing service, or as a hybrid solution combining a hardware device and a cloud service.
IDS systems can perform packet filtering for both incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) packets into and from a secure network. This is done by separating the network into a secure and unsecure zone. This can prevent attacks from within the secure network to outside address as well as prevent outside attacker spoofing the address of machine within a secure zone.
If the attack is coming from a small number of attack sources, another approach is to implement IP-based access control lists (ACL) to block all traffic originating from the attack sources.
If the target of the attack is an application- or a web-based service, you could limit the volume of traffic or the number of concurrent application connections by implementing rate-limiting. Note that this approach is prone to high degrees of false positives because it cannot distinguish between malicious and legitimate user traffic.
Many application DDoS attacks using IP address spoofing may target application server resources by targeting TCP handshake. For such attacks, many load balancers have countermeasures built in for protection from such attacks.
Newer approaches block attacks without impacting legitimate traffic by using machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes legitimate behavior profile and then automatically block malicious attacks. This increases protection accuracy while minimizing false positives.

What is DNS Flood Attack (DNS Flooding)
What is DNS Flood Attack (DNS Flooding)?
Domain Name System (DNS) are the directories used to resolve between machine-readable addresses of websites (such as 191.168.0.1:80) and human-readable names (e.g. radware.com)
A DNS flood is a type of DDoS (distributed denial-of-service attack) when an attacker floods a particular domain’s DNS servers to disrupt resolution for that domain.
How does a DNS flood attack work?
Sending a massive number of DNS requests to a DNS server can consume its resources, resulting in a significantly slower response time for legitimate DNS requests.
By slowing down or disrupting DNS resolution, a DNS Flood attack will disable or degrade the performance of a website, API or web application's ability respond to legitimate traffic.



How can a DNS Flood attack be mitigated?
Since DNS name resolution is used in normal internet communication, during heavy loads, DNS Flood attacks can be difficult to distinguish from normal heavy traffic especially if the floods have many unique sources.
Attackers exploit the DNS’ hierarchical infrastructure weaknesses and protocol vulnerabilities for mounting attacks against DNS services, targeting either recursive resolvers or authoritative servers. Many such attacks such as DNS amplification, DNS spoofing, Reflection, NXDomain and NXNSDomain are now common.
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were introduced in 2005 to preclude spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
DNS over HTTPS or DoH was introduced to increase the privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data through man-in-the-middle attacks.
Although DNSSEC and DoH can help with authentication, privacy and integrity; however, they cannot protect from query floods, NXDomain and NXNSDomain attacks.
Securing the perimeter is key to protecting DNS infrastructure. You’ll need a security solution that can detect and mitigate an attack based on ingress requests only and prevent the bad queries from entering your DNS infrastructure to begin with. Not relying on a bi-directional response detection can also minimize impacts from bogus domain requests.
Since high-volume floods can consume resources of stateful devices you need a stateless DNS security solution.
Accurate attack filtering with minimal risk of false positives requires achieving a high detection accuracy between a good and a bad DNS request. Behavioral algorithms can detect statistical anomalies in DNS traffic and generate an accurate attack footprint based on a heuristic protocol information analysis to prevent and protect from DNS Flood attacks.
How Radware mitigates DNS Flood Attacks
Radware DDoS protection solutions mitigate DNS Flood attacks via behavioral-based protection. Protection is provided across all three phases of an attack: detection, characterization and mitigation.
During the detection phase, Radware monitors all inbound DNS traffic and learns the baseline of normal DNS traffic behavior using various logics and monitoring various baselines and parameters. During the characterization phase, Radware creates an automatic, real-time signature, which blocks the DNS attack without human intervention. Using samples of real-time traffic that deviates from the baseline traffic, Radware looks for characteristic parameters of the ongoing anomaly in the suspicious traffic. Lastly, during the mitigation phase, Radware utilizes the real-time signature to identify the DNS attack traffic and automatically stops the attack.

What is a Slowloris DDoS Attack?
Slowloris is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that works by flooding a server with incomplete HTTP requests. The attacks are designed to exploit the limited number of connections that web and application servers can support and the time it takes for the server to close them. In a Slowloris attack, malicious actors send numerous partial requests to the targeted server, preventing legitimate users from being able to access it.
How does Slowloris work?
Slowloris works by exploiting what is known as the “Keep-Alive” header of an HTTP request. This header informs the server that there will be additional requests in the future, so an attacker can send multiple incomplete requests and keep them open until the server reaches its connection limit, at which point it will be unable to process new requests from legitimate users.
The attacker then sends additional incomplete requests to maintain control over existing connections and prevent legitimate users from accessing the server. By sending just enough data with each request, without completing it, attackers can effectively tie up resources on a webserver for extended periods of time without using too much bandwidth or computing power.

How can a Slowloris attack be mitigated?
There are several steps organizations can take to mitigate Slowloris attacks:
Increase webserver connection limits: This can help reduce vulnerability to Slowloris attacks as it increases the maximum number of open connections that an attacker needs to maintain control over resources on the target webserver.
Implement rate limiting: Rate limiting involves restricting incoming requests from any given IP address in order to prevent DoS attacks such as those launched by Slowloris attackers. It is essential for organizations to regularly monitor their networks for traffic abnormalities that could indicate malicious activity and take immediate action if necessary.
Use load balancers and web application firewalls (WAFs): WAFs help protect against application DDoS attacks such as those launched using Slowloris techniques by identifying and blocking malicious traffic before it reaches your network or applications. They also provide logs which organizations can review in order to identify any potential threats or anomalies quickly and take action accordingly. Load balancers and reverse proxies can buffer connections and implement multiple connection management techniques to prevent incomplete HTTP requests from affecting applications and web servers.
Organizations should also consider using services such as cloud-based DDoS protection or botnet tracking solutions in order to identify suspicious activity quickly and respond appropriately.
Additionally, security best practices such as keeping software updated and patching vulnerabilities regularly should be followed at all times in order to minimize risk and protect against all types of threats, including those posed by malicious actors who use techniques like slowloris DDoS attacks.
Radware DDoS protection, WAF service, and application delivery solutions mitigate slowloris attacks by using approaches that block attacks without impacting legitimate traffic. Radware uses machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes a legitimate behavior profile and then automatically blocks malicious attacks while managing user connections effectively, without impacting legitimate HTTP requests. This increases protection accuracy while minimizing false positives and disruption to legitimate users


-https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/application-security/http-flood/

What is an HTTP Flood DDoS attack?
An HTTP Flood attack is a Layer 7 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that targets web and application servers. The HTTP Flood attack executes a DDoS attack by using HTTP GET or HTTP POST requests. The requests are valid and target available resources, hence making HTTP Flood attacks difficult to protect against.
Anonymized HTTP Flood attacks may also spoof a client IP address to prevent tracking the attacker.
How does an HTTP Flood attack work?
During an HTTP Flood attack, the attacker floods the target application and web servers with HTTP GET or POST requests. The numerous HTTP GET and POST requests cause the web and application server connection threads to allocate system resources to process incoming requests. The connection requests may also be initiated by botnets and cause the exhaustion of web and application server resources. The web and application servers thus enter a denial-of-service state for processing any requests from legitimate traffic.

How is an HTTP Flood attack mitigated?
Due to the unique nature of its mechanism, the best approach to mitigate an HTTP Flood attack is a combination of network and application layer security.
Network security focuses on blacklisting attackers and IP addresses known to be associated with HTTP Flood attacks, rate-limiting requests, and checking the behavior profile of each request. Application layer security focuses on patching vulnerabilities in web applications, implementing rate limits from known bad actors and addresses, and using CAPTCHA and crypto challenges. It also uses DDoS protection services, load balancers, and web application and API protection.
Organizations can take these steps to mitigate HTTP Flood attacks:
Increase web and application server connection limits: This can help reduce vulnerability to HTTP Flood DDoS attacks by increasing the number of concurrent HTTP connections that may be processed. Additionally, timeouts may be implemented to free up web and application server connection resources.
Implement rate limiting: Rate limiting involves restricting incoming requests from any given IP address in order to prevent DDoS attacks such as those launched by HTTP Flood attackers. Note that, if anonymized, IP addresses could be spoofed which may lead to incorrect rate limits.
Use load balancers and web application firewalls (WAFs): WAFs help protect against HTTP Flood attacks using HTTP GET and POST by using various mechanisms such as CAPTCHA and crypto challenges, and applying bot mitigation techniques. Load balancers and reverse proxies can buffer connections and implement multiple connection management techniques to prevent HTTP GET and POST requests from affecting applications and web server resources.
Use services such as cloud-based DDoS protection or botnet tracking: These solutions can help to identify suspicious activity quickly and respond appropriately.
Always maintain Security best practices: Keep software updated and patch vulnerabilities regularly. This will help to minimize risk and protect against all types of threats, including those posed by malicious actors who use techniques like HTTP Flood DDoS attacks.
Use Radware DDoS protection (DefensePro, Cloud DDoS Protection Service), WAAP and Cloud WAAP, and Alteon (with integrated WAAP) solutions: Mitigate HTTP Flood DDoS attacks by using approaches that block attacks without impacting legitimate traffic and use machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes a legitimate behavior profile. Then, automatically block malicious attacks while managing user connections effectively without impacting legitimate HTTP requests. This increases protection accuracy while minimizing false positives and disruption to legitimate users.

DDoS Meaning: What Is A DDoS Attack?
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple machines are operating together to attack one target to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
DDoS allows for exponentially more requests to be sent to the target, therefore increasing the attack power. It also increases the difficulty of attribution, as the true source of the attack is harder to identify.
DDoS attacks can be devasting to an online business, which is why understanding how they work and how to mitigate them quickly is critical.
Motivations for carrying out a DDoS vary widely, as do the types of individuals and organizations who execute DDoS attacks. Some attacks are carried out by disgruntled individuals and hacktivists wanting to take down a company's servers simply to make a statement, have fun by exploiting a weakness, or express disapproval.
Other distributed denial-of-service attacks are financially motivated, such as a competitor disrupting or shutting down another business's online operations to steal business away in the meantime. Others involve extortion, in which perpetrators attack a company and install ransomware on their servers, then force them to pay a large financial sum for the damage to be reversed.
How Does a DDoS Attack Work?
A DDoS attack aims to overwhelm the devices, services, and network of its intended target with fake internet traffic, rendering them inaccessible to or useless for legitimate users.
While a simple denial-of-service attack involves one “attack” computer and one victim, a DDoS relies on an army of infected or “bot” computers able to carry out tasks simultaneously. These botnets —a group of hijacked internet-connected devices – are capable of executing large scale attacks. Attackers take advantage of security vulnerabilities or device weaknesses to control numerous devices using command and control software. Once in control, an attacker can command their botnet to conduct DDoS on a target. In this case, the infected devices are also victims of the attack.
Botnets—made up of compromised devices—may also be rented out to other potential attackers. Often the botnet is made available to “attack-for-hire” services, which allow unskilled users to launch DDoS attacks.
In a DDoS attack, cybercriminals take advantage of normal behavior that occurs between network devices and servers, often targeting the network devices that establish a connection to the internet. Therefore, attackers focus on the edge network devices (e.g., routers, switches), rather than individual servers. A DDoS attack overwhelms the network’s pipe, (the bandwidth) or the devices that provide that bandwidth.

How To Identify A DDoS Attack?
The best way to detect and identify a DDoS attack would be via network traffic monitoring and analysis. Network traffic can be monitored via a firewall or intrusion detection system. An administrator may even set up rules that create an alert upon the detection of an anomalous traffic load and identify the source of the traffic or drops network packets that meet a certain criteria.
Symptoms of a DoS attack can resemble non-malicious availability issues, such as technical problems with a particular network or a system administrator performing maintenance. However, the following symptoms could indicate a DoS or DDoS attack:
Unusually slow network performance
Unavailability of a particular network service and/or website
An inability to access any website
An IP address makes an unusually large number of requests in a limited timespan
Server responds with a 503 error due to a service outage
Log analysis indicated a large spike in network traffic
Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unusual
Main Types of DDoS Attacks
DDoS and network-layer attacks are as diverse as they are sophisticated. Due to the growing array of online marketplaces, it is now possible for attackers to execute DDoS attack with little to no knowledge of networks and cyberattacks. Attack tools and services are easy to access, making the pool of possible assaults larger than ever.
Here are four of the most common, and sophisticated, DDoS attacks currently targeting organizations.
Application, Layer-7 DDoS Attacks
Application DoS attacks target resource exhaustion by using the well-known Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as well as HTTPS, SMTP, FTP, VOIP and other application protocols that possess exploitable weaknesses, allowing for DoS attacks. Much like attacks targeting network resources, attacks targeting application resources come in a variety of flavors, including floods and “low and slow” attacks.

Volumetric or Volume-Based Attacks
Volumetric and reflection/amplification attacks take advantage of a disparity of request and response ratios in certain technical protocols. The attackers send packets to the reflector servers with a source IP address spoofed to their victim’s IP, therefore indirectly overwhelming the victim with the response packets. At high rates, these responses have generated some of the largest volumetric DDoS attacks to date. A common example is a reflective DNS amplification attack

SSL/TLS And Encrypted Attacks
Attackers use SSL/TLS protocols to mask and further complicate attack traffic in both network and application-level threats. Many security solutions use a passive engine for SSL/TLS attack protection, meaning they cannot effectively differentiate encrypted attack traffic from encrypted legitimate traffic while only limiting the rate of request.
Stopping assaults like these requires DDoS mitigation that combines automated, machine-learning based detection and mitigation capabilities with comprehensive protection for any infrastructure: on premise, private cloud and public cloud.
Web DDoS Tsunami Attack
Web DDoS Tsunami attacks combine application layer attack vectors, leveraging new tools to create sophisticated attacks that are harder—and sometimes impossible—to detect and mitigate with traditional methods.
How To Prevent DDoS Attacks
To prevent DDoS attacks, there are several key capabilities organizations should consider to mitigate DDoS attacks, ensure service availability and minimize false positives. Leveraging behavioral-based technologies, understanding the pros and cons of different DDoS deployment options and having the ability to mitigate an array of DDoS attack vectors is essential to preventing DDoS attacks.
The following capabilities are critical to preventing DDoS attacks:
Automation
With today's dynamic and automated DDoS attacks, organizations do not want to rely on manual protection. A service that does not require any customer intervention with a fully automated attack lifecycle - data collection, attack detection, traffic diversion and attack mitigation – ensures better quality protection.
Behavioral-Based Protection
A DDoS mitigation solution that blocks attacks without impacting legitimate traffic is key. Solutions that leverage machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes legitimate behavior and automatically blocks malicious attacks are critical. This increases protection accuracy and minimizes false positives.
Scrubbing Capacity and Global Network
DDoS attacks are increasing in quantity, severity, complexity and persistence. If faced with large volumetric or simultaneous assaults, cloud DDoS services should provide a robust, global security network that scales with several Tbps worth of mitigation capacity with dedicated scrubbing centers segregating clean traffic from DDoS attack traffic.
Multiple Deployment Options
Flexibility of deployment models is crucial so an organization can tailor its DDoS mitigation service to suit its needs, budget, network topology and threat profile. The appropriate deployment model – hybrid, on-demand or always-on cloud protection – will vary based on network topology, application hosting environments and sensitivity to delays and latency.
Comprehensive Protection Against An Array Of Attack Vectors
The threat landscape is consistently evolving. A DDoS mitigation solution that offers the widest protection, is not limited to just network-layer attack protection and includes protection against the aforementioned attack vectors is crucial.
How To Mitigate DDoS Attacks
There are several important steps and measures an organization can follow to mitigate a DDoS attack. This includes timely communication with both internal stakeholders and 3rd providers, attack analysis, activation of basic countermeasures (such as rate limiting) and more advanced DDoS mitigation protection, and analysis.
Here are five steps to follow to mitigate a DDoS attack.
Step 1: Alert Key Stakeholders
Alert key stakeholders within the organization of the attack and steps that are being taken to mitigate it.
Examples of key stakeholders include the CISO, security operations center (SoC), IT director, operations managers, business managers of affected services, etc. Keep the alert concise but informative.
Key information should include:
What is happening
When the attack started
Which assets (applications, services, servers, etc.) are being impacted
Impact to users and customers
What steps are being taken to mitigate the attack
Step 2: Notify Your Security Provider
You will also want to alert your security provider and initiate steps on their end to help mitigate the attack.
Your security provider could be your internet service provider (ISP), web hosting provider or a dedicated security service. Each vendor type has different capabilities and scope of service. Your ISP might help you minimize the amount of malicious network traffic reaching your network, whereas your web hosting provider might help you minimize application impact and scale your service accordingly. Likewise, security services will usually have dedicated tools for dealing with DDoS attacks.
Even if you don’t already have a predefined agreement for service, or are not subscribed to their DDoS protection offering, you should nonetheless reach out to them to see how they can assist.
Step 3: Activate Countermeasures
If you have already have anti-DDoS countermeasures in place, activate them. Ideally, these countermeasures will initiate immediately when an attack is detected. However, in some cases, certain tools – such as out-of-path hardware devices or manually-activated, on-demand mitigation services – might require the customer to initiate them manually.
One approach is to implement IP-based access Control lists (aCls) to block all traffic coming from attack sources. This is accomplished at the network router level and can usually be accomplished by either your network team or your ISP. This is a useful approach if the attack is coming from a single source or a small number of attack sources. However, if the attack is coming from a large pool of IP address, this approach might not help.
If the target of the attack is an application- or a web-based service, you could limit the number of concurrent application connections. This approach is known as rate-limiting and is frequently the favored approach by web hosting providers and CDNs. Note that this approach is prone to high degrees of false positives because it cannot distinguish between malicious and legitimate user traffic.
Dedicated DDoS protection tools will give you the widest coverage against DDoS attacks. DDoS protection measures can be deployed either as an appliance in your data center, as a cloud-based scrubbing service, or as a hybrid solution combining a hardware device and a cloud service.
Step 4: Monitor Attack Progression
Throughout the attack, monitor the progression of the attack to see how it develops. This should include:
What type of DDoS attack is it? Is it a network-level flood or an application-layer attack?
What are the attack characteristics? How large is the attack, both in terms of bits-per-second and of packets-per-second?
Is the attack coming from a single IP source or multiple sources? Can you identify them?
How does the attack pattern look like? Is it a single sustained flood or is it a burst attack? Does it involve a single protocol or does it involve multiple attack vectors?
Are the targets of the attack staying the same or are attackers changing their targets over time?
Tracking attack progression will also help you tune your defenses to stop it.
Step 5: Assess Defense Performance
Finally, as the attack develops and countermeasures are activated, assess their effectiveness.
Your security vendor should provide a service level agreement document which commits their service obligations. Ensure they’re meeting their SLAs and whether there is an impact to your operations. If they’re not, or not able to stop the attack whatsoever, now is the time to assess whether you need to make an emergency change to your service.

What Is A DNS Amplification Attack?
Domain Name System (DNS) are the directories used to resolve between machine-readable addresses of websites (such as 191.168.0.1:80) and human-readable names (e.g. radware.com)
In a DNS amplification attack, an attacker uses IP address spoofing to launch a reflected DNS attack against a target.
How Does A DNS Amplification Attack Work?
In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends altered source IP of the intended victim to the DNS resolvers.
Each query to the open DNS resolvers is legitimate and small in nature, however they have altered source IP address of the intended target victim.
The queries to the open DNS resolvers are structured in a way to maximize the response size from the DNS resolvers.
This results in DNS resolvers sending large responses to the intended target IP. Many such queries to as many open DNS resolvers can amplify responses to the target IP address.
This can be amplified manyfold by using a distributed botnet.
How Can A DNS Amplification Attack Be Mitigated?
For the DNS amplification attack to work, attackers need access to open DNS resolvers. Since the objective is to amplify DNS resolver responses to the intended target IP address of the victim, the mitigation should include specific measures that reduce the availability of open DNS resolvers that only respond to request from trusted sources and source IP addresses should be verified.
IPS and IDS can perform packet filtering for both incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) packets into and from a secure network. This is done by separating the network into a secure and unsecure zone. This can prevent attacks from within the secure network to outside address as well as prevent outside attacker spoofing the address of machine within a secure zone.
Verifying IP addresses can also mitigate flooding a target IP address.
The target network may also implement volume and rate limits to prevent DDoS attack using DNS amplification. Newer approaches block attacks without impacting legitimate traffic by using machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes legitimate behavior profile and then automatically block malicious attacks. This increases protection accuracy while minimizing false positives.

What Is a Web DDoS Tsunami Attack?
What Is a Web DDoS Tsunami Attack?
A Web DDoS Tsunami attack is an evolved type of HTTP DDoS Flood cyberattack that is sophisticated, aggressive and very difficult to detect and mitigate without blocking legitimate traffic.
Characteristics of a Web DDoS Tsunami attack include:
Very high level of requests per second (RPS)
Attack traffic is encrypted
Once decrypted, traffic appears legitimate
Multiple methods of evasion: randomized headers, IP spoofing and more
Where Did Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks Come From?
Web DDoS Tsunami attacks were developed during the new era of hacktivist activity sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Attack tactics began with high-volume network-based Flood attacks. Later, they evolved to more sophisticated multi-vector application-level attacks that are hard to detect and mitigate. As many of these attacks are launched by state-sponsored groups or by organized cyber hacktivism/terrorism, they are better thought out and planned and take advantage of large-scale resources and sophisticated scripts.
These cyberattacks focus on denial of service and the defacement of websites around the world. Targets include:
Hospitals
Airports
Utilities
Government
Media
Financial services
How Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks Work
Web DDoS Tsunami attacks combine application layer attack vectors, leveraging new tools to create sophisticated attacks that are harder—and sometimes impossible—to detect and mitigate with traditional methods.
They leverage sophisticated evasion techniques to bypass traditional app protections, such as randomizing HTTP methods, headers and cookies. They impersonate popular embedded third-party services and spoof IPs and other key targets. Application-level attack methods include HTTPS Get, Push and Post request attacks with changing parameters behind proxies and dynamic IP attacks. All look like legitimate requests.
The time it takes to analyze the attack and deploy a rule means significant downtime—lasting from minutes to hours—in every iteration of the attack. All of this and the continuous morphing of the attack result in continuous downtime.
Why Are Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks So Difficult to Detect and Mitigate?
Network-based DDoS Protection solutions cannot detect and accurately mitigate Layer 7 DDoS attacks. Because this would require the decryption of attack traffic and deeper inspection of Layer 7 headers, attacks go undetected by network-based protection solutions. And while standard on-prem or cloud-based web application firewalls (WAFs) are effective against standard web-based threats, they fail to protect against Web DDoS Tsunami attacks for these reasons:

Scale
The rate of some of these attacks, measured by RPS, is reaching new heights. Over the past year, several multi-million RPS attacks were observed by multiple third parties and publicly disclosed. The rates and volume of traffic by far exceed the capacity of on-prem solutions.

Attack Sophistication
These attacks appear as legitimate traffic requests and are constantly randomized. There is no pre-defined signature or rule-based mechanisms because requests appear legitimate and do not contain any specific bad arguments. Only behavioral-based algorithms with self-learning and auto-tuning can detect and mitigate.

Morphing Attacks
The dynamic nature of these new threats—the frequency in which they change and sustain these changes over a long period of time—is unprecedented. To protect against such attacks, organizations need solutions that can quickly adapt in real-time to the attack campaign. A standard on-prem or cloud-based WAF is not able to provide that.

Human Factor
The sophistication of attack campaigns requires security experts that can handle the complexity of the attacks and ensure the quality of protection is not compromised during an attack. Self-managed teams, limited in personnel, tools and budgets, cannot cope with a 24x7 attack campaign. Also, on-prem tools are mainly rule-based and require definition of new rules for mitigation.

How To Mitigate Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks
To protect against Web DDoS Tsunami attacks, organizations must use a cybersecurity solution with dedicated, behavioral-based algorithms to quickly detect and surgically block Layer 7 DDoS attacks without blocking legitimate traffic. It’s important to choose a solution that is uniquely designed to protect against these large and sophisticated attacks and provide customers with advanced protection at the scale needed.
The solution should include:

Accurate, Automated Detection and Mitigation
Dedicated, behavioral-based algorithms with advanced learning capabilities to quickly detect and surgically block Layer 7 DDoS attacks while minimizing false positives and allowing legitimate traffic. In contrast to the common volumetric approach of most vendors, Layer 7 behavioral-based protection can accurately distinguish between a legitimate surge in traffic (aka flash crowd) and a flood of attack traffic generated by adversaries. It must ensure that only malicious traffic is blocked—even during Web DDoS Tsunami attacks.

Widest Layer 7 DDoS Attack Coverage
Protection from a wide range of Layer 7 DDoS threats includes smaller-scale, sophisticated attacks, new Layer 7 attack tools and vectors, and large-scale, sophisticated Web DDoS Tsunami attacks. Your solution must be able to analyze advanced threats as well as their numerous variants. It also needs to adapt to any attack patterns, randomization methods and attack techniques.

Immediate and Adaptive Protection
The right solution must leverage proprietary behavioral analysis and real-time signature generation to detect and block HTTPS floods and continuously adapt the mitigation in real-time to the hyper-dynamic changes in attack traffic to prevent downtime.
Benefits of Comprehensive Application Protection

How Does A WAF Protect Against These Common Attacks?
Additional Resources
Web application firewalls (WAF) are one of the first lines of defense when it comes to stopping web application attacks. A WAF protects web applications and websites by filtering, monitoring and analyzing hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) traffic between the web applications and the internet.
A WAF protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, server-side request forgery, file inclusion, and SQL injections, and many more.
Here are seven of the most common attacks a WAF is designed to mitigate.

Injection Attacks
Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) injection, have been a perennial favorite among hackers for some time. An injection flaw occurs when suspicious data is inserted into an application as a command or query. This hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.
The most common code injection is SQL injection, which is an attack that is accomplished by sending malformed code to the database server. It’s a simple and quick attack type that almost anyone with internet access can accomplish since SQL injection scripts are available for download and are easily acquirable.
Predictable Resource Location Attacks
Predictable resource location is an attack technique used to uncover hidden website content and functionality. By making educated guesses via brute forcing, an attacker can guess file and directory names not intended for public viewing. Brute forcing filenames is easy because files/paths often have common naming conventions and reside in standard locations. These can include temporary files, backup files, logs, administrative site sections, configuration files, demo applications, and sample files. These files may disclose sensitive information about the website, web application internals, database information, passwords, machine names, file paths to other sensitive areas, etc.
This will not only assist the attacker with identifying the site surface which may lead to additional site vulnerabilities, but also may disclose valuable information to an attacker about the environment or its users. Predictable resource location is also known as forced browsing, forceful browsing, file enumeration and directory enumeration.
HTTP DDoS (Flood)
HTTP Flood is a type of distributed denial-of-service attack method used by hackers to attack web servers and applications. HTTP Floods work by directing large amounts of HTTP requests at a webpage to overload target servers with requests.
In an HTTP Flood, the HTTP clients, such as web browsers, interact with an application or server to send HTTP requests. The request can be either “GET” or “POST.” The aim of the attack is to compel the server to allocate as many resources as possible to serving the attack, thus denying legitimate users access to the server's resources. Such requests are often sent en masse by means of a botnet, increasing the attack's overall power.
These DDoS attacks may be one of the most advanced non-vulnerability threats facing web servers today. It is very hard for network security devices to distinguish between legitimate HTTP traffic and malicious HTTP traffic, and if not handled correctly, it could cause a high number of false-positive detections. Rate-based detection engines are also not successful at detecting these types of attacks, as the traffic volume of HTTP Floods may be under detection thresholds. Because of this, it is necessary to use several parameters detection, including rate-based and rate-invariant.
The vast majority of internet traffic nowadays is encrypted. Most HTTP Flood attacks are HTTPS Floods. Not only are encrypted floods more potent because of the high amount of server resources required to handle them, but they also add a layer of complexity to mitigating such attacks since DDoS defenses usually cannot inspect the contents of the HTTPS requests without fully decrypting all traffic.
HTTP Request Smuggling
HTTP Request Smuggling, also known as HTTP Desync Attacks, is an attack technique for interfering with the way a website processes sequences of HTTP requests that are received from one or more users. It allows the attacker to "smuggle" a request to a web server without the devices between the attacker and the web server being aware of it. HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities are often critical in nature, allowing an attacker to bypass security controls, interfere with other user sessions, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and directly compromise other application users.
File Path Traversal / Directory Traversal
A file path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. These files might include application code and data, credentials for back-end systems and sensitive operating system files.
Attackers achieve a file path traversal attack by tricking either the web server, or the web application running on the server, into returning files that exist outside of the web root folder.
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is when an attacker exploits a web security vulnerability to induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.
In such an attack, the threat actor can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or modify a URL, which the code running on the server will read or submit data to and enable the attacker to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP-enabled databases or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed.
A successful SSRF attack can often result in unauthorized actions or access to data within the organization, either in the vulnerable application itself or on other back-end systems that the application can communicate with. In some situations, the SSRF vulnerability might allow an attacker to perform arbitrary command execution. In some cases, an SSRF exploitation that causes connections to external third-party systems might result in malicious onward attacks that would be perceived as originating from the organization hosting the vulnerable application.
Clickjacking
Clickjacking is a type of attack that happens on the client side, and its purpose is to trick the application users into clicking on something different than what they perceive. Hackers execute this type of attack by hiding malware or malicious code in a legitimate-looking control on a website, mainly in JavaScript of third-party services which often are not monitored by the application standard security tools, thus exploiting vulnerabilities in the application supply chain.
It is a malicious technique used by an attacker to record the infected user’s clicks on the internet. This can be used to direct traffic to a specific site or to make a user like or accept a Facebook application. More nefarious purposes might be to collect sensitive information saved on a browser, such as passwords, or to install malicious content.
How Does A WAF Protect Against These Common Attacks?
WAFs leverage various capabilities and mechanisms to protect application from this diverse array of attacks. This can include dynamic security policies with automatic false-positive correction, application-layer 7 DDoS protection, API discovery and protection, bot mitigation, and more.
The majority of WAFs leverage a negative security model, which defines what is disallowed while implicitly allowing everything else. Since attack signatures may generate false positives by detecting legitimate traffic as attack traffic, such rules tend to be simplistic, attempting to detect obvious attacks. The result is protection against the lowest common denominator.
A positive security model, which defines the set of allowed types and values, is required to provide comprehensive protection where signature-based protection cannot fill the gap. In the case of a SQL injection, a positive security model screens user input for known patterns of attacks and leverages logic to tell the difference between legitimate user input and injection flaws. A positive security model is also critical to successfully mitigating the risks associated with SSRF.
Here are six key capabilities to consider when evaluating a WAF that can mitigate these common attacks and vulnerabilities:
Complete API discovery and protection that provides visibility, enforcement and mitigation of all forms of API abuse and manipulation for both on-premise and cloud-hosted environments
Built-in HTTP DDoS protection to stop application-layer DDoS attacks
Integrated bot management to detect and mitigate sophisticated, generation 3 and generation 4 bots that mimic human behavior
Data leakage prevention mechanisms to automatically mask sensitive user data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Combination of a negative and positive security model that uses advanced behavioral-analysis technologies to detect malicious threats
Policy refinement engines that can continuously optimize security policies and adapt to changes in the application, traffic and threat landscape

DoS Attack (Denial of Service Attack)
A DoS or Denial-of-Service attack is an attack targeting the availability of web applications. Unlike other kinds of attacks, the primary goal of a DoS attack is not to steal information but to slow or take down a web site. The attackers' motivations are diverse, ranging from simple fun, to financial gain and ideology ( hacktivism ). A denial of service attack generates high or slow rate attack traffic exhausting computing resources of a target, therefore preventing legitimate users from accessing the website.
Denial-of-Service/DoS attacks affect enterprises from all sectors (e-gaming, Banking, Government etc.), all sizes (mid/big enterprises) and all locations. They target the network layer and up to the application layer, where attacks are more difficult to detect since they could easily get confused with legitimate traffic.
There are several types of denial of service attacks. Non distributed DoS attacks are when an attacker uses a single machine's resources to exhaust those of another machine, in order to prevent it from functioning normally. Large Web servers are usually robust enough to withstand a basic denial of service attack from a single machine without suffering performance loss. A famous variant is the DDoS, or Distributed Denial of Service attack , where the attack originates from multiple computers simultaneously, therefore causing the victim's resources exhaustion.

What Is A DDoS Attack?

DDoS Meaning: What Is A DDoS Attack?
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple machines are operating together to attack one target to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.
DDoS allows for exponentially more requests to be sent to the target, therefore increasing the attack power. It also increases the difficulty of attribution, as the true source of the attack is harder to identify.
DDoS attacks can be devasting to an online business, which is why understanding how they work and how to mitigate them quickly is critical.
Motivations for carrying out a DDoS vary widely, as do the types of individuals and organizations who execute DDoS attacks. Some attacks are carried out by disgruntled individuals and hacktivists wanting to take down a company's servers simply to make a statement, have fun by exploiting a weakness, or express disapproval.
Other distributed denial-of-service attacks are financially motivated, such as a competitor disrupting or shutting down another business's online operations to steal business away in the meantime. Others involve extortion, in which perpetrators attack a company and install ransomware on their servers, then force them to pay a large financial sum for the damage to be reversed.
How Does a DDoS Attack Work?
A DDoS attack aims to overwhelm the devices, services, and network of its intended target with fake internet traffic, rendering them inaccessible to or useless for legitimate users.
While a simple denial-of-service attack involves one “attack” computer and one victim, a DDoS relies on an army of infected or “bot” computers able to carry out tasks simultaneously. These botnets —a group of hijacked internet-connected devices – are capable of executing large scale attacks. Attackers take advantage of security vulnerabilities or device weaknesses to control numerous devices using command and control software. Once in control, an attacker can command their botnet to conduct DDoS on a target. In this case, the infected devices are also victims of the attack.
Botnets—made up of compromised devices—may also be rented out to other potential attackers. Often the botnet is made available to “attack-for-hire” services, which allow unskilled users to launch DDoS attacks.
In a DDoS attack, cybercriminals take advantage of normal behavior that occurs between network devices and servers, often targeting the network devices that establish a connection to the internet. Therefore, attackers focus on the edge network devices (e.g., routers, switches), rather than individual servers. A DDoS attack overwhelms the network’s pipe, (the bandwidth) or the devices that provide that bandwidth.

How To Identify A DDoS Attack?
The best way to detect and identify a DDoS attack would be via network traffic monitoring and analysis. Network traffic can be monitored via a firewall or intrusion detection system. An administrator may even set up rules that create an alert upon the detection of an anomalous traffic load and identify the source of the traffic or drops network packets that meet a certain criteria.
Symptoms of a DoS attack can resemble non-malicious availability issues, such as technical problems with a particular network or a system administrator performing maintenance. However, the following symptoms could indicate a DoS or DDoS attack:
Unusually slow network performance
Unavailability of a particular network service and/or website
An inability to access any website
An IP address makes an unusually large number of requests in a limited timespan
Server responds with a 503 error due to a service outage
Log analysis indicated a large spike in network traffic
Odd traffic patterns such as spikes at odd hours of the day or patterns that appear to be unusual
Main Types of DDoS Attacks
DDoS and network-layer attacks are as diverse as they are sophisticated. Due to the growing array of online marketplaces, it is now possible for attackers to execute DDoS attack with little to no knowledge of networks and cyberattacks. Attack tools and services are easy to access, making the pool of possible assaults larger than ever.
Here are four of the most common, and sophisticated, DDoS attacks currently targeting organizations.
Application, Layer-7 DDoS Attacks
Application DoS attacks target resource exhaustion by using the well-known Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as well as HTTPS, SMTP, FTP, VOIP and other application protocols that possess exploitable weaknesses, allowing for DoS attacks. Much like attacks targeting network resources, attacks targeting application resources come in a variety of flavors, including floods and “low and slow” attacks.

Volumetric or Volume-Based Attacks
Volumetric and reflection/amplification attacks take advantage of a disparity of request and response ratios in certain technical protocols. The attackers send packets to the reflector servers with a source IP address spoofed to their victim’s IP, therefore indirectly overwhelming the victim with the response packets. At high rates, these responses have generated some of the largest volumetric DDoS attacks to date. A common example is a reflective DNS amplification attack

SSL/TLS And Encrypted Attacks
Attackers use SSL/TLS protocols to mask and further complicate attack traffic in both network and application-level threats. Many security solutions use a passive engine for SSL/TLS attack protection, meaning they cannot effectively differentiate encrypted attack traffic from encrypted legitimate traffic while only limiting the rate of request.
Stopping assaults like these requires DDoS mitigation that combines automated, machine-learning based detection and mitigation capabilities with comprehensive protection for any infrastructure: on premise, private cloud and public cloud.
Web DDoS Tsunami Attack
Web DDoS Tsunami attacks combine application layer attack vectors, leveraging new tools to create sophisticated attacks that are harder—and sometimes impossible—to detect and mitigate with traditional methods.
How To Prevent DDoS Attacks
To prevent DDoS attacks, there are several key capabilities organizations should consider to mitigate DDoS attacks, ensure service availability and minimize false positives. Leveraging behavioral-based technologies, understanding the pros and cons of different DDoS deployment options and having the ability to mitigate an array of DDoS attack vectors is essential to preventing DDoS attacks.
The following capabilities are critical to preventing DDoS attacks:
Automation
With today's dynamic and automated DDoS attacks, organizations do not want to rely on manual protection. A service that does not require any customer intervention with a fully automated attack lifecycle - data collection, attack detection, traffic diversion and attack mitigation – ensures better quality protection.
Behavioral-Based Protection
A DDoS mitigation solution that blocks attacks without impacting legitimate traffic is key. Solutions that leverage machine-learning and behavioral-based algorithms to understand what constitutes legitimate behavior and automatically blocks malicious attacks are critical. This increases protection accuracy and minimizes false positives.
Scrubbing Capacity and Global Network
DDoS attacks are increasing in quantity, severity, complexity and persistence. If faced with large volumetric or simultaneous assaults, cloud DDoS services should provide a robust, global security network that scales with several Tbps worth of mitigation capacity with dedicated scrubbing centers segregating clean traffic from DDoS attack traffic.
Multiple Deployment Options
Flexibility of deployment models is crucial so an organization can tailor its DDoS mitigation service to suit its needs, budget, network topology and threat profile. The appropriate deployment model – hybrid, on-demand or always-on cloud protection – will vary based on network topology, application hosting environments and sensitivity to delays and latency.
Comprehensive Protection Against An Array Of Attack Vectors
The threat landscape is consistently evolving. A DDoS mitigation solution that offers the widest protection, is not limited to just network-layer attack protection and includes protection against the aforementioned attack vectors is crucial.
How To Mitigate DDoS Attacks
There are several important steps and measures an organization can follow to mitigate a DDoS attack. This includes timely communication with both internal stakeholders and 3rd providers, attack analysis, activation of basic countermeasures (such as rate limiting) and more advanced DDoS mitigation protection, and analysis.
Here are five steps to follow to mitigate a DDoS attack.
Step 1: Alert Key Stakeholders
Alert key stakeholders within the organization of the attack and steps that are being taken to mitigate it.
Examples of key stakeholders include the CISO, security operations center (SoC), IT director, operations managers, business managers of affected services, etc. Keep the alert concise but informative.
Key information should include:
What is happening
When the attack started
Which assets (applications, services, servers, etc.) are being impacted
Impact to users and customers
What steps are being taken to mitigate the attack
Step 2: Notify Your Security Provider
You will also want to alert your security provider and initiate steps on their end to help mitigate the attack.
Your security provider could be your internet service provider (ISP), web hosting provider or a dedicated security service. Each vendor type has different capabilities and scope of service. Your ISP might help you minimize the amount of malicious network traffic reaching your network, whereas your web hosting provider might help you minimize application impact and scale your service accordingly. Likewise, security services will usually have dedicated tools for dealing with DDoS attacks.
Even if you don’t already have a predefined agreement for service, or are not subscribed to their DDoS protection offering, you should nonetheless reach out to them to see how they can assist.
Step 3: Activate Countermeasures
If you have already have anti-DDoS countermeasures in place, activate them. Ideally, these countermeasures will initiate immediately when an attack is detected. However, in some cases, certain tools – such as out-of-path hardware devices or manually-activated, on-demand mitigation services – might require the customer to initiate them manually.
One approach is to implement IP-based access Control lists (aCls) to block all traffic coming from attack sources. This is accomplished at the network router level and can usually be accomplished by either your network team or your ISP. This is a useful approach if the attack is coming from a single source or a small number of attack sources. However, if the attack is coming from a large pool of IP address, this approach might not help.
If the target of the attack is an application- or a web-based service, you could limit the number of concurrent application connections. This approach is known as rate-limiting and is frequently the favored approach by web hosting providers and CDNs. Note that this approach is prone to high degrees of false positives because it cannot distinguish between malicious and legitimate user traffic.
Dedicated DDoS protection tools will give you the widest coverage against DDoS attacks. DDoS protection measures can be deployed either as an appliance in your data center, as a cloud-based scrubbing service, or as a hybrid solution combining a hardware device and a cloud service.
Step 4: Monitor Attack Progression
Throughout the attack, monitor the progression of the attack to see how it develops. This should include:
What type of DDoS attack is it? Is it a network-level flood or an application-layer attack?
What are the attack characteristics? How large is the attack, both in terms of bits-per-second and of packets-per-second?
Is the attack coming from a single IP source or multiple sources? Can you identify them?
How does the attack pattern look like? Is it a single sustained flood or is it a burst attack? Does it involve a single protocol or does it involve multiple attack vectors?
Are the targets of the attack staying the same or are attackers changing their targets over time?
Tracking attack progression will also help you tune your defenses to stop it.
Step 5: Assess Defense Performance
Finally, as the attack develops and countermeasures are activated, assess their effectiveness.
Your security vendor should provide a service level agreement document which commits their service obligations. Ensure they’re meeting their SLAs and whether there is an impact to your operations. If they’re not, or not able to stop the attack whatsoever, now is the time to assess whether you need to make an emergency change to your service.

Botnet Definition: What Is a Botnet and How Does It Work?
By definition, botnets are networks of hijacked computers and internet-connected devices that are infected by malware (i.e., malicious software). The malware runs bots on the compromised devices without the knowledge of device users. Botnets—a combination of the words “robot” and “network”—are usually controlled by a botmaster or bot herder. The bot herder essentially turns these hijacked computer devices into remote-controlled “zombie” computers. By linking compromised devices in large numbers, it becomes possible to create botnets that can be leveraged against various targets to carry out distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, account takeover, data theft and several other types of attacks.

How Do Botnets Work?
Bot herders create botnets by spreading malware to infect PCs, smartphones and internet of things (IoT) devices including security cameras, smoke detectors, digital video recorders and many other smart devices. This is achieved through various means such as social engineering, website and application vulnerabilities, and exploit kits and Trojan software which infect targeted devices without alerting their owners. Exploit kits can be purchased on the dark web or created by hackers and are often concealed in seemingly legitimate downloadable files, including free software, music, or video content. Malware can even be of the self-installing “drive-by” type that is widespread on shady websites. These don’t even need to be clicked on to infect a device. After the bot software is installed on compromised zombie computers, they are ready to receive commands from their bot herders to execute actions based on the intentions of their controller. The controller of a botnet can direct its activities through communication channels based on network protocols such as IRC and HTTP, both as peer-to-peer networks or directed by a central command and control (C&C) device.
What Does a Botnet Do?
Botnets can perform the same functions as individual bots, but on a far larger scale. They're able to carry out often overwhelming attacks on their targets. Though most conventional bots are based on scripts and web browsers, botnets can also be built on malicious software that is designed for rapid infestation across many vulnerable devices. Once installed, the botnet software can often function with administrative privileges on the infected device. This gives bot herders virtually unhindered access to the device’s memory, processor, data storage and allows the botnet controller to remotely execute any actions that the device user is capable of performing.
Botnets are capable of:
Reading and writing system data
Gathering personal data from infected devices
Sending files and other data
Monitoring users’ activities
Searching for vulnerabilities in other devices
Installing and running any applications
Botnet Actions Include:
Email spam: Botnets have often been used to widely distribute email spam. This allows for drive-by downloads triggered without user intervention, phishing links that fool unsuspecting users into clicking and automatically installing malware, and various other malicious acts.
DDoS attacks: Botnets have been responsible for some of the most large-scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Through their sheer volume, these attacks can slow down unprotected networks and servers, and disrupt the normal functioning of websites, mobile applications, and APIs. DDoS attacks have often been linked to criminal networks and nation states with the intention of crippling or even bringing down their adversaries’ networks. They can affect the normal functioning of public goods such as power, water, sanitation systems, financial institutions, marketplaces and other types of targets that can cause inconvenience, disruption, or frustration to their users.
Financial breaches: Botnets are known to have infiltrated financial institutions including banks and payment processors to exfiltrate confidential consumer and business data, which can be further used to carry out other forms of fraud.
Targeted intrusions: Botnets can be used to execute credential stuffing attacks, in which lists of breached and stolen username and password pairs are rapidly entered to gain access to devices and user accounts, both on devices and websites or applications. In a similar manner, botnets can also be used for credential cracking attacks, in which random passwords are generated and entered in the hope of eventually guessing the correct password.
Crypto-currency mining and fraud: Botnets can leverage the processing power of thousands or even millions of infected devices to mine crypto-currencies and steal access to coin lockers or wallets.
Information theft: Malicious actors have used botnets to cast a wide net to steal personal and organizational data which can be further abused to carry out fraud, impersonation, blackmail and financial crimes.
Ad fraud: Botnets have been used to execute ad fraud, in which legitimate ads and their embedded links are replaced by fraudulent ads with embedded links that bring traffic (and potentially, revenue) to websites controlled by the bot herder. Botnets are also used to generate fake clicks on ads to generate false impressions and game the ad-tech ecosystem for profit.
How is a botnet controlled?
Command and Control (C&C) of botnets are generally carried out by two methods:
Centralized: The Client-Server Botnet Model
The first known botnets initially used to be exclusively controlled using client-server models in which a domain, website, or Internet Relay Chat channel controlled by the bot herder is contacted by the bot software on infected devices to both receive orders and transmit data back to the controller. This centralized command model is rarely used anymore as various global law enforcement and security agencies have tracked and shut down their central servers in recent years, thus crippling botnets that were based on this model.
Decentralized: The Peer-to-Peer Botnet Model
Due to aggressive action by security agencies in cracking down on centralized C&C botnet servers around the world, the decentralized P2P model is now almost universally used to control botnets. This eliminates centralized control which has a single point of failure that is vulnerable to being shut down by law enforcement agencies and replaces it with decentralized peer-to-peer control. P2P botnets find other infected devices by scanning random IP addresses to establish contact. If a machine is infected, it conveys its list of installed bots to the infected machine that contacted it, which can then relay updates and commands from the botnet controller to herd the new additions to the botnet to execute commands.

Examples of botnet attacks
As bot technology and the sophistication of botnets grow increasingly more capable and powerful, new, record-setting botnets are uncovered every few months that eclipse the size and attack potential of previous botnets. Three of the largest, most damaging botnets in the recent past are:
Mirai Botnet
The Mirai botnet was uncovered in 2016 and was responsible for massive 1 Terabit/second DDoS attacks on OVH, a French web hosting firm. Dyn, a DNS service provider, was also attacked by Mirai, which took some of the most prominent websites around the world offline, including Netflix, Twitter, Reddit and Github.
3ve Botnet
3ve was a botnet used to carry out ad fraud using nearly 2 million PCs and over a million compromised IP addresses. It clicked on ads on over 10,000 fake websites and raked in an estimated $30 million in fraudulent gains before it was taken down by the FBI.
Mantis Botnet
In 2022, a small but incredibly powerful botnet named “Mantis” infected a relatively small number of about 5000 servers and launched an unprecedented 26 million RPS (requests-per-second) DDoS attack using the HTTPS protocol against ISP, media, telecommunications, finance, and gaming websites. Using powerful servers rather than far less powerful IoT and desktop PCs allowed the Mantis botnet to carry out HTTPS attacks that require far more computational resources to execute.
How to Protect Organizations from Botnets
Protecting an organization’s website, mobile application and APIs from botnet attacks require a combination of security measures that can work in concert to secure against malicious attacks such as DDoS, account takeover (ATO), data theft, spam and other types of attacks.
Bot Mitigation
The most crucial security defense against botnets is a solution such as Radware Bot Manager. Our solution leverages a combination of Radware’s patented intent-based deep behavioral analysis, collective bot intelligence, semi-supervised machine learning, device and browser fingerprinting, and anomaly detection based on variance from normal user flows.
DDoS Protection
In addition to bot detection and mitigation, solutions such as Radware’s Cloud DDoS Protection Service and DefensePro are an essential component to prevent DDoS attacks, which are one of the hallmark applications of malicious botnets.


- https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/bot-management/rate-limiting/

What is rate limiting and how does it work?
What Is Rate Limiting?
Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate at which requests are made to a service by a client or an application. It is a strategy for managing and regulating traffic flow to ensure that the service remains available and responsive. This is achieved by placing restrictions on the number of requests that can be made over a specified period of time.
A useful tool for preventing resource abuse and ensuring fair use of services, rate limiting can be used to control traffic flow to web servers, APIs, or other online services. By setting a limit on the number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame, it can prevent the overloading of servers and reduce the risk of downtime or slow response times.
Rate limiting is particularly important in preventing DDoS attacks which involve sending a flood of requests to a server or service to overwhelm its capacity and cause it to crash. It can also be used to block or delay requests from a single IP address or client that exceeds a specified threshold, making it more difficult for attackers to overwhelm the server or service.
In summary, rate limiting is a method of controlling traffic flow to a service or server by restricting the number of requests that can be made within a certain time frame. It is an essential technique for preventing resource abuse, ensuring fair use of services and protecting against DDoS attacks.

Rate-Limiting API
API rate limiting is used to control the rate at which requests are made to an Application Programming Interface (API) by a client or an application. An API is a set of protocols and tools for building software applications that allows different applications to interact with each other. Rate limiting is an important mechanism for managing API traffic and ensuring that the service remains available and responsive.
This technique works by setting a limit on the number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame. For example, an API provider might set a rate limit of 100 requests per minute for a specific endpoint. Once a client or application reaches this limit, any further requests are blocked or delayed until the next time window begins.
API rate limiting can help prevent overloading of servers, reduce the risk of downtime and ensure that resources are used fairly among all clients or applications. It can also help to protect against DDoS attacks, where attackers attempt to overwhelm an API by sending a flood of requests.
API rate limiting can also be implemented using different techniques, such as setting time-based limits, using quotas or tokens, or using dynamic algorithms to adjust the rate limit based on the load on the system. Some API providers may also offer different rate limits for different endpoints or different levels of service.
In summary, API rate limiting is a method of controlling traffic flow to an API by setting limits on the number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame. It is an essential technique for managing API traffic, protecting against resource abuse and ensuring fair use of API resources.
Which Attacks Are Prevented by Rate Limiting?
Rate limiting plays a critical role in protecting against a variety of attacks that attempt to overwhelm a system by sending an excessive number of requests. By controlling the rate at which requests are made, rate limiting can prevent resource exhaustion, reduce the risk of downtime and protect against different types of attacks.
Three types of attacks that can be prevented by rate limiting are:
1. DDoS attacks - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks involve sending a massive number of requests to a system or service to overwhelm it, causing it to become unresponsive or unavailable. Rate limiting can help to prevent DDoS attacks by blocking or delaying requests from a single IP address or client that exceeds a specified threshold, making it more difficult for attackers to overwhelm the system.
2. Brute force attacks - Brute force attacks involve repeatedly attempting to guess login credentials or other sensitive information by using automated tools to send a large number of requests. Rate limiting can help to prevent brute force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts that can be made within a specific time frame, making it more difficult for attackers to guess valid credentials.
3. API abuse - API abuse involves sending a large number of requests to an API with the intention of extracting large amounts of data or causing resource exhaustion. Rate limiting can help to prevent API abuse by limiting the number of requests that can be made by a single client or application, ensuring that API resources are used fairly among all clients and preventing resource exhaustion.
Rate limiting is a critical technique for preventing attacks that attempt to overwhelm a system or service by controlling the rate at which requests are made. It can help to protect against DDoS attacks, brute force attacks, API abuse and other types of attacks that rely on excessive traffic or resource consumption.
How Does Rate Limiting work?
Rate limiting works by controlling the rate at which requests are made to a system or service. It sets a limit on the number of requests that can be made within a specific time frame, typically measured in seconds, minutes, or hours. When the limit is reached, the system or service may either delay or reject further requests until the next time window begins.
Rate limiting can be implemented in several ways, including:
Token bucket algorithm - This algorithm involves adding tokens to a bucket at a fixed rate. When a request is made, a token is removed from the bucket. If no tokens are available, the request is delayed or rejected.
Leaky bucket algorithm - This algorithm involves filling a bucket at a fixed rate and allowing requests to drain from the bucket at a fixed rate. If the bucket overflows, the requests are delayed or rejected.
Rolling window algorithm - This algorithm involves counting the number of requests made within a sliding time window, typically measured in seconds or minutes. The window slides forward with each request, and requests that exceed the limit are blocked or delayed.
Fixed window algorithm - This algorithm involves counting the number of requests made within a fixed time window and blocking or delaying requests that exceed the limit.
Implementing rate limiting correctly can be challenging, as it requires balancing the need for availability and responsiveness with the need to prevent resource abuse and protect against attacks. Rate limiting needs to be carefully tuned to ensure that it does not block legitimate traffic, under-protect against attacks or cause other harm to your business.
Furthermore, rate limiting needs to be adapted to the specific requirements and characteristics of the system or service being protected. For example, a service with high peak loads may require different rate-limiting strategies than a service with consistent, low-level traffic.
Rate-Limiting Types
There are several different types of rate limiting, each with its own advantages and limitations. The three main types of rate limiting are IP-based, server-based and geography-based.
1. IP-based rate limiting: IP-based rate limiting works by setting limits on the number of requests that can be made by a single IP address within a specific time frame. This type of rate limiting is commonly used to prevent DDoS attacks, as it can block or delay requests from a single IP address that exceed a specified threshold.
Advantages: IP-based rate limiting is easy to implement and can be effective in preventing attacks from a single IP address. It can also be used to limit the amount of traffic that comes from a specific IP address to prevent resource exhaustion.
Limitations: IP-based rate limiting can be circumvented by attackers who use multiple IP addresses or dynamic IP addresses. It can also block legitimate traffic from a shared IP address, such as those from a company or university.
Example scenario: An online retailer implements IP-based rate limiting to prevent bots from scraping its website and stealing its product data. The rate limit is set to 10 requests per minute per IP address to prevent abusive behavior, while still allowing legitimate traffic to access the site.
2. Server-based rate limitingServer-based rate limiting works by setting limits on the number of requests that can be made to a specific server within a specific time frame. This type of rate limiting is commonly used to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair use of server resources.
Advantages: Server-based rate limiting is effective in preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring fair use of server resources. It can also be used to manage peak loads and ensure that the server remains responsive during times of high traffic.
Limitations: Server-based rate limiting can be circumvented by attackers who distribute their requests across multiple servers. It can also block legitimate traffic if the limit is set too low or if the server is overloaded.
Example scenario: A music streaming service implements server-based rate limiting to prevent its API from being overloaded with requests during peak times. The rate limit is set to 100 requests per second per server to ensure fair use of server resources while maintaining responsiveness.
3. Geography-based rate limiting: Geography-based rate limiting works by setting limits on the number of requests that can be made from a specific geographical region within a specific time frame. This type of rate limiting is commonly used to prevent attacks from specific regions, such as those where a large number of malicious requests originate.
Advantages: Geography-based rate limiting can be effective in preventing attacks from specific regions and can help to reduce the risk of resource exhaustion. It can also be used to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in specific regions.
Limitations: Geography-based rate limiting can be circumvented by attackers who use proxy servers or VPNs to hide their location. It can also block legitimate traffic from a specific region, such as those from users who travel frequently or use virtual machines.
Example scenario: A social media platform implements geography-based rate limiting to prevent spam and abusive behavior from a specific region known for high levels of malicious activity. The rate limit is set to 10 requests per minute per IP address originating from that region to prevent abusive behavior while still allowing legitimate traffic to access the platform.
Rate-Limiting Algorithms
There are several algorithms used in rate limiting, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here are three examples:
1. Token Bucket Algorithm
The Token Bucket Algorithm works by imagining a bucket that fills up with tokens at a constant rate, and each request takes a certain number of tokens. Requests are allowed if there are enough tokens in the bucket, and tokens are added back to the bucket at the constant rate.
Example: A web server implements the Token Bucket Algorithm to limit the number of requests from a single IP address to 50 per minute. The server fills the bucket with tokens at a rate of 10 per minute, and each request takes one token. If an IP address tries to make a request when there are no tokens in the bucket, the request is blocked.
2. Leaky Bucket Algorithm
The Leaky Bucket Algorithm works by imagining a bucket that has a hole in the bottom. Requests fill the bucket, and requests are allowed as long as the bucket is not full. If the bucket fills up, excess requests overflow and are discarded. The bucket is emptied at a constant rate.
Example: An email service implements the Leaky Bucket Algorithm to limit the number of emails sent by a single user to 10 per hour. The bucket can hold up to 10 emails, and each new email fills the bucket. If the bucket is full, excess emails are discarded. The bucket is emptied at a rate of one email per six minutes.
3. Fixed Window Counter Algorithm:
The Fixed Window Counter Algorithm works by counting the number of requests that occur within a fixed time window, such as a minute or an hour. If the number of requests exceeds a set limit, further requests are blocked until the next time window.
Example: A REST API implements the Fixed Window Counter Algorithm to limit the number of requests per minute to 100. If a client sends more than 100 requests in a minute, further requests are blocked until the next minute starts.
Rate Limiting with Radware
Radware's rate-limiting solution is designed to protect against various types of attacks, including DDoS attacks, brute force attacks and web scraping. The solution works by applying different rate limits to various types of traffic, such as HTTP/HTTPS, DNS and SIP to prevent resource abuse and ensure the availability of critical services.
Radware uses advanced algorithms to dynamically adjust the rate limits based on the current traffic conditions. The solution leverages machine learning and behavioral analysis to detect abnormal traffic patterns and apply the appropriate rate limit to prevent attacks while allowing legitimate traffic to pass.
Radware also provides granular control over the rate limits, allowing administrators to set different limits for different types of traffic and specific IP addresses. The solution can also be configured to generate alerts and notifications when rate limits are exceeded, allowing administrators to take proactive measures to prevent attacks.
Radware uses positive and negative security to provide complete protection against web application attacks, access violations, attacks disguised behind CDNs, API manipulations, advanced HTTP-based assaults, brute force attacks on login pages and more. This combination allows for precise policy definitions, which helps to prevent both false positives and false negatives.
The negative security model relies on updated signatures that can detect and block known vulnerabilities in application vulnerabilities. In contrast, the positive security model is useful in preventing zero-day attacks. It does so by allowing the definition of value types and ranges for all client-side inputs, including encoded inputs, and structured formats such as XMLs and JSONs. Positive security profiles restrict user input to the minimum level required for proper application functionality, effectively preventing zero-day attacks.
Positive security model is designed to allow only known and trusted traffic to pass through while blocking everything else. This is achieved by defining a set of rules that explicitly permit traffic based on the characteristics of the traffic, such as the source IP address, destination IP address, port number and protocol type. For example, if a web server is being attacked with a DDoS attack, the positive security model can be implemented to allow only legitimate traffic from known sources to access the server. This means that requests from IP addresses that are not on the whitelist will be blocked or limited, effectively mitigating the DDoS attack.
On the other hand, the negative security model is designed to block known and suspected malicious traffic while allowing everything else to pass through. Rate limiting can also be used as a mechanism to control the amount of traffic allowed to pass through based on these rules.
For example, if a web server is being targeted by a specific type of attack, such as SQL injection, the negative security model can be implemented using rate limiting to block or limit requests that match the pattern of the attack. This means that requests that are suspected to be malicious will be blocked or limited, effectively mitigating the attack.

Bot detection is the process of analyzing all the traffic to a website, mobile application, or API, in order to detect and block malicious bots, while allowing access to legitimate visitors and authorized partner bots.
Bot detection is the process of identifying and distinguishing between human users and automated bots on websites, applications, or digital platforms. Bots are software programs that can perform tasks automatically, often with malicious or unwanted intentions. Bot detection aims to protect systems from the negative impacts of bot activity, such as fraudulent transactions, data scraping, account takeovers, or website spamming. It involves deploying various techniques and tools, such as user behavior analysis, IP analysis, machine learning algorithms, CAPTCHA challenges, and device fingerprinting, to accurately identify and differentiate between human users and bots. Effective bot detection helps maintain the integrity, security, and performance of online platforms by mitigating the risks associated with bot-driven activities.
How to Detect Bots: Bot Detection Techniques
User behavior analysis
Analyze user behavior patterns, such as mouse movements, keystrokes, and page navigation, to detect anomalies that may indicate bot activity.
IP analysis
Examine the IP addresses associated with user interactions to identify suspicious or known bot IPs. This can involve blacklisting or using IP reputation databases.
Human interaction challenges
Introduce interactive challenges, such as asking users to solve puzzles or provide context-based responses, that require human understanding and problem-solving skills to deter bots.
Device fingerprinting
Create unique device fingerprints based on factors like browser settings, installed plugins, screen resolution, and operating system to distinguish between human users and bots.
Machine learning algorithms
Utilize machine learning models to analyze large datasets and identify patterns and features that differentiate bots from human users. These models can be trained using labeled data to improve accuracy.
Bot signature detection
Maintain a database of known bot signatures, such as specific user agents or HTTP headers, and compare incoming requests against these signatures to flag potential bot activity.
Time-based analysis
Monitor the time taken to complete certain actions or interactions on a website or application. Unusually fast completion times may indicate automated bot activity.
Behavior-based heuristics
Define a set of rules and heuristics that capture common bot behavior, such as rapid form completion or high-frequency requests, and use these rules to detect potential bots.
Traffic analysis
Analyze patterns and characteristics of incoming traffic, such as unusual spikes in requests or a high percentage of traffic coming from a single source, to identify bot-generated traffic.
CAPTCHA challenges
Implement CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) to verify whether a user is human by presenting them with a challenge that bots typically struggle to solve.
These techniques are not foolproof, and sophisticated bots may be designed to mimic human behavior or bypass certain detection methods. Therefore, a combination of multiple techniques and continuous monitoring through a dedicated bot management solution is necessary to effectively detect and mitigate bot activity.
WHY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FAILING TO MANAGE RISING BOT ATTACKS
Bot Detection Tools
Obsolete methods of blocking bots:
Rule-based measures: Block IP ranges, countries, and data centers associated with bot activity.
Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Access Control Lists (ACL): Used to detect and block bad bots but less effective against advanced bots.
In-house bot detection measures:
Initially deployed by some organizations but have disadvantages compared to specialized solutions.
Ineffective in detecting advanced bad bots.
Specialized bot management solution like Radware Bot Manager:
Combine cutting-edge technology and robust algorithms for bot detection.
Utilizes methodologies including:

oMachine learning (ML) in detection engine:
Trains algorithms based on known patterns and historical data.
Detects new types of bots using ML techniques.
Patented semi-supervised ML techniques detect malicious activities even without definitive bot signatures.
FREE BOT ANALYSIS: RADWARE BAD BOT ANALYZER
JavaScript Bot Detection
Radware Bot Manager's API call and embedded JavaScript tag collect and share several parameters about the visitor for processing by bot detection engine. Bot Manager’s detection engine works in real time to analyze every visitor to a website, mobile application, and API, and develops a unique fingerprint for each visitor and bot.
If a visitor is a human or search engine or partner bot, Bot Manager allows access in a few milliseconds—without slowing down the user experience. However, when a bad bot is detected, Bot Manager can block it, show a CAPTCHA, feed it with fake data, and utilize other types of responses based on an organization’s needs.
FIVE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATING BOT MANAGEMENT WITH YOUR CDN
Essentials of a Bot Detection Solution
A bot detection and management solution should detect and manage every kind of bot ─ good as well as bad ─ based on an organization’s specific needs. It should work in real-time to identify bot traffic and take measures such as blocking, showing a CAPTCHA to solve, feeding it with fake data, or dropping the connection, among other measures. Bot management tools should also be able to easily integrate with a wide range of Web and application infrastructure architectures to suit the unique needs of their users.

How To Stop Or Block Bots On Website?
Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. They can perform various functions, such as crawling web pages, sending messages, posting comments, playing games, and more. Bots can be classified into two categories: good bots and malicious bots.
Good bots are those that follow the rules and protocols of the websites they visit, and provide useful services to users and webmasters. For example, search engine crawlers are good bots that index web pages and help users find relevant information. Other examples of good bots are chatbots, social media bots, and weather bots.
Malicious bots are those that violate the rules of the websites they visit, and cause harm or damage to website owners and users. DDoS bots, for example, are malicious bots that flood a website with traffic and make it unavailable to legitimate users. Other types of malicious bots are data scraping bots, carding bots, and spam bots, to mention just a few.
Malicious bots pose serious risks and potential harm to the internet and its users. They can compromise the security, privacy, and performance of websites and online services. They can also manipulate online content, influence public opinion, spread misinformation, and disrupt online communities. Malicious bots can also affect the economy by stealing business and personal data, intellectual property, and revenue from legitimate businesses.
How to Identify Malicious or “Bad” Bots
Malicious bots are automated programs that can harm your website, mobile app, and/or API. They can be used for a variety of attacks such as account takeover, DDoS attacks, ad and payment fraud, web scraping, and several other types of attacks. Detecting and blocking these bots is crucial for protecting your business against online fraud and security threats.
Common traits that can help identify malicious bot activity are:
Unusual Communication Frequency:
Bots tend to communicate continuously with their targets to receive commands, send keep-alive signals, or exfiltrate data. By monitoring the communication frequency between hosts and targets, you can identify patterns that may indicate the presence of a bot.
Unusual Patterns of Page Views:
While humans exhibit relatively predictable patterns of page views, bots, on the other hand, may exhibit unusual patterns of page views that can be indicative of their presence.
Unusual Traffic Origination Patterns:
Bots often use a range of IP addresses to carry out their activities. By monitoring website traffic and blocking the IP addresses accessing your site, you can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate the presence of a malicious bot.
A Spike in Unsuccessful Log-in Attempts:
Bots may attempt to take over user accounts using breached or stolen credentials. A sudden spike in unsuccessful log-in attempts can be a sign of bot activity.
Bot detection tools from Radware can help block bad bots by using advanced techniques such as behavioral modeling, collective bot intelligence, and fingerprinting. Radware's Bot Manager safeguards web applications, mobile apps, and APIs against automated threats by providing real-time detection and a range of mitigation options. It also includes secure identity and device attestation for native iOS and Android mobile applications to prevent identity spoofing, tampering, and replay attacks.
Why is Monitoring Website Traffic Important?
Monitoring website traffic is important because it provides valuable insights into the behavior of your website visitors. Monitoring traffic helps identify patterns and trends that can help you optimize your website for better user engagement and conversion rates. Continuous monitoring also allows you to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise, such as a sudden drop in traffic or an increase in bounce rates.
There are several tools available that can assist in traffic monitoring. Some popular tools include Google Analytics, CrazyEgg, Kissmetrics and StatCounter. These tools provide businesses with the capabilities necessary to view network traffic, measure network traffic, and analyze network traffic without requiring any former network monitoring experience.
Techniques to Stop or Block Bots
Implementing CAPTCHAs and Challenges
CAPTCHA is an acronym for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart". They are a type of challenge-response test commonly used in computing to determine whether the user is human or not. CAPTCHAs are designed to prevent spam, bot attacks, and data scraping on websites by presenting tasks that are easy for humans but hard for computers. For example, humans can easily read distorted text or identify objects in images, but computers may struggle with these tasks. By requiring users to pass a CAPTCHA test, websites can filter out unwanted traffic and protect their resources and services.
How Effective are CAPTCHAs in Deterring Basic Bots?
CAPTCHAs are not foolproof and can be bypassed by various methods, such as using optical character recognition (OCR) software, hiring human solvers, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA implementation. However, these methods have their limitations and costs. OCR software may not be able to handle complex or noisy images, human solvers may charge fees or have ethical issues, and vulnerabilities may be patched or rare. Hence CAPTCHAs can still provide a reasonable level of security against basic bots that do not employ these evasive methods.
The effectiveness of CAPTCHAs also depends on their design and difficulty. A poorly designed or too easy CAPTCHA may not pose much of a challenge to bots, while a well-designed or too hard CAPTCHA may frustrate or exclude legitimate human users. Therefore, CAPTCHAs need to balance usability and security, and adapt to the changing capabilities of both humans and bots.
Advanced CAPTCHA Challenges
As bots become more sophisticated and capable of solving traditional CAPTCHAs, such as text or image recognition, new types of CAPTCHAs have emerged to counter them. Some of these new types of CAPTCHAs include:
Interactive Challenges:
These require users to interact with an element on the page, such as clicking a button, moving a slider, or typing a word. These tasks are designed to measure the user's behavior and timing, which can distinguish humans from bots. For example, Google's reCAPTCHA v3 assigns a score to each user based on their interactions with the website, and decides whether to present a further challenge or not.
Puzzle-based CAPTCHAs:
These require users to solve a simple puzzle, such as sliding a piece into a slot, rotating an image, or dragging and dropping items. These tasks are easy for humans but hard for bots to perform without manual intervention or complex algorithms.
Radware’s Crypto Challenge:
Crypto Challenge is a mitigation solution based on the cryptographic proof-of-work concept used in various blockchains. It is designed to deliver continuous, invisible browser-based challenges to suspected bots that automatically and exponentially become more difficult if solved. This challenge-response model creates a 'Cyber Counter Strike' by forcing an attacker's CPU to work harder and longer, thus taking a toll on the attacker's resources. The Crypto Challenge provides a convenient CAPTCHA-free user experience for legitimate users while mitigating sophisticated CAPTCHA-solver and avoider bots. This solution helps protect your website, mobile app, and/or API against automated threats by providing real-time detection and a range of mitigation options.
Rate Limiting and Throttling Requests
Rate limiting and request throttling are techniques used to control the rate at which users can access a website or API. Rate limiting restricts the number of requests that a user can make within a given time frame, while request throttling slows down the rate at which requests are processed. These techniques can be set up to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address within a given time frame. If an IP address exceeds this limit, any additional requests from that IP address will be blocked until the next minute.
While rate limiting and request throttling can be effective in mitigating bot activity, there are potential drawbacks to these techniques. One potential drawback is that they may inadvertently limit genuine users. One such case is when multiple users are accessing your website from the same IP address (such as a shared office or public Wi-Fi network), they may be blocked by the rate limit even though they are not bots. Additionally, some bots may use multiple IP addresses to bypass rate limits, making it more difficult to detect and block them.
Employing Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
A WAF is a security solution that filters and monitors HTTP/HTTPS traffic between a web application and the Internet. It is designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet, and block requests that violate predefined security rules.
Radware offers a range of solutions in this area, including its AppWall WAF and Cloud WAF. AppWall is a WAF that provides full coverage of OWASP Top-10 threats and automatically adapts protections to evolving threats and protected assets. It uses advanced technologies such as machine learning, behavioral analysis, and negative/positive security models to accurately detect and block malicious bot traffic. Radware's Cloud WAF is a cloud-based solution that provides the same level of protection as AppWall, but with the added benefits of scalability, flexibility, and ease of deployment.
Using Specialized Bot Management and Mitigation Solutions
A specialized, dedicated solution like Radware Bot Manager can effectively and accurately block bad bots, leveraging a range of advanced technologies including machine learning, behavioral analysis, and collective bot intelligence. Bot Manager also includes secure identity and device attestation for native iOS and Android mobile applications to prevent identity spoofing, tampering, and replay attacks. Radware Bot Manager defends websites, mobile applications, and/ or APIs against automated threats by providing real-time detection and a range of bot-handling options.
IP Blacklisting and Geofencing
IP blacklisting is a security measure that blocks traffic from specific IP addresses that are known to be associated with malicious activity. This can be an effective way to prevent attacks from known bad actors, but it is not a foolproof solution. Malicious actors can easily change their IP addresses, and legitimate users may be inadvertently blocked if they share an IP address with a blacklisted entity.
Geofencing is the practice of using geographic location data to restrict access to specific content or services. This can be used to block traffic from specific regions that are known to be associated with high levels of malicious activity. An organization could use geofencing to block all traffic from countries that are known to be sources of cyber-attacks, though this is generally considered to be too broad an approach.
While IP blacklisting and geofencing can be effective tools for blocking malicious traffic, there are potential limitations and risks associated with over-reliance on these techniques. One potential limitation is that legitimate users may also be blocked by the blacklist even though they are not malicious actors. Additionally, attackers may use techniques such as IP spoofing or VPNs to bypass these restrictions, making it more difficult to detect and block them.
User Behavior Analysis
By analyzing user behavior, you can identify patterns that are indicative of bot activity. For example, bots may exhibit unusual patterns of page views or communication frequency that can be used to detect their presence.
Device Fingerprinting
Device fingerprinting is the practice of collecting information about a user’s device in order to identify it. This information can be used to detect and block bots that are using spoofed or fake device information.
Honeypots
A honeypot is a security mechanism that is designed to attract and trap bots. By setting up a honeypot on your website, you can lure bots into interacting with it, allowing you to identify and block them.
The Importance of Regularly Updating Security Measures
Bot threats are dynamic in nature and constantly evolving. As technology advances, so do the capabilities of bots, making it necessary for businesses to remain vigilant and stay current with the latest security patches and solutions. This means regularly updating software and systems, as well as implementing the latest security measures to protect against new and emerging threats.
Staying updated with the latest security patches and solutions is crucial for effectively mitigating bot threats. This includes keeping your operating systems, web browsers, and other software current with the latest security patches, as well as implementing the latest security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software. By staying informed about the latest threats and taking proactive measures to protect against them, you can help ensure the safety and security of your digital touchpoints.


- https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/bot-management/antibot/

Antibot Solution
Antibot solutions follow a real-time approach when it comes to blocking bots. They use robust algorithms to detect, analyze and categorize bot patterns and bot signatures along with the help of data science experts. Antibot solutions use multiple methodologies, like unique device fingerprinting, dynamic turing tests and user behavior analysis etc. to uncover bot activity. Antibot solutions also ensure zero false positives, so that no user is penalized.
How to Choose an Antibot Solution
As advanced bots have started to adopt ‘behavioral hijacking’ techniques which replicate the way users typically interact with their smartphones and PCs, the need of the hour is for specialized solutions that are backed by the latest machine learning and artificial intelligence methodologies to differentiate between humans and bots.
A.Negligible false positives
Bots are constantly evolving to better mimic human behavior and go undetected by security systems. A false positive detection occurs when a human visitor is mistaken to be a bot, and hence blocked or made to solve a CAPTCHA (or otherwise made to prove that he/she is not a bot). Blocking humans leads to lost business, consumer frustration, and a poor brand reputation. On the other hand, a false negative ─ a bot being mistaken for a human ─ can be even more damaging if the bot proceeds to attempt account takeovers, carding attacks, spam and other malicious activities. When choosing a solution, its ability to accurately detect bots is a crucial consideration.
B.Visualization and management
Look for a solution that provides comprehensive visualization and management features. You should be able to easily see granular details about your traffic trends, and get insights into bot types, origins, and intent. Bot management features such as customizable generation-wise bad bot management, blocking by country or ISP of origin, and being able to take specific actions against bots on any your web pages ─ such as blocking, throttling, showing a CAPTCHA, feeding fake data, and so on ─ are great to have.
C.Easy integration and compatibility
A good antibot solution should ideally be capable of being integrated with a wide range of web infrastructure to suit the needs of any organization. Seamless integration with your website, mobile application or APIs ensures complete bot protection and helps your web and security teams spend a minimal amount of time and effort managing bots. With the advent of the GDPR regulations, it is more important than ever to consider solutions that help you prevent data breaches that could lead to punitive fines and loss of reputation.
Different industries have unique requirements based on the bot threats they are most impacted by. In addition, based on where your organization is located, compliance requirements or government regulations may dictate how a bot management should be integrated into your infrastructure stack.


- https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/bot-management/behavioral-analysis/
What Is Behavioral Analysis?
The behavior of a user on a Web page or mobile application is significantly different from the behavior of an automated bot. Typical users of a website or mobile app have a behavioral characteristic in terms of number of pages visited per session, time spent on each page, frequency of repeat visits, and so on.
Radware Bot manager uses this method, among others, to differentiate between humans and non-human traffic.
A user model is constructed for each individual site based on historical data that can be checked for anomalies and deviations, allowing bot activities to be accurately identified.


- https://www.radware.com/cyberpedia/bot-management/bot-management/

What Is Bot Management?
Bot management is, at its core, the process of identifying, categorizing, and managing bot traffic on a website or application. It involves blocking undesired or malicious “bad” bots while still allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management accomplishes this by detecting bot activity, differentiating between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifying the sources of the undesirable activity.
Bad bots can cause massive problems for web properties. Too much bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (DDoS attacks are an extreme version of this scenario). Bad bots can also scrape or download content from a website, steal user credentials, take over user accounts, rapidly post spam content, and perform various other kinds of attacks. Bot management is necessary to prevent these performance and security impacts on websites, applications, and APIs, by leveraging a range of security, machine learning, and web development technologies to accurately detect bots and block malicious activity while allowing legitimate bots to operate uninterrupted.
The Importance of Bot Management
A bot manager is crucial in ensuring specialized, enterprise-grade defense against sophisticated bots that carry out malicious attacks against websites, applications, and APIs operated by every type of industry and organization. A solution such as Radware Bot Manager safeguards digital touchpoints against automated threats by using behavioral modeling, collective bot intelligence, and fingerprinting to protect against critical risks like account takeover, DDoS, ad and payment fraud, web scraping, and other types of attacks.
The impact of bots on businesses can be both good and bad. Good bots, such as search engine crawlers, can help direct traffic to a website and improve its visibility. However, malicious bots can cause harm by stealing data, committing fraud, scraping protected content, and overloading servers, affecting the user experience.
Effective bot management is necessary to protect digital assets and maintain a secure environment. By filtering bot traffic and allowing only useful bots to access web properties while blocking malicious or unwanted bots, businesses and other organizations can prevent damaging performance and security impacts. Organizations can choose to handle bots through specific mitigation policies that best suit their specific needs.
Good Bots vs. Bad Bots
Good bots and bad bots have different roles and objectives. Good bots are designed to help businesses and users and can improve customer experiences. For example, search engine bots crawl the web to index content so that it can show up in searches, or help consumers find the best prices. On the other hand, bad bots are used to execute malicious objectives, and can significantly harm organizations and users by stealing data, taking over user accounts, submitting junk data through online forms, and performing other malicious activities.
Typically, good bots have two main criteria that make them distinguishable from bad bots: they do not hide their identity as bots and they follow rules and policies laid out in a website’s “robots.txt” file. They are typically deployed by legitimate, well-known companies that provide useful services. Bad bots neither obey webmasters’ rules for bots, nor do they identify themselves clearly as good bots do—though they are known to try to pass themselves off as legitimate bots.
How Does Bot Management Work?
The general process of bot management involves detection, analysis, response, and monitoring. There are three main approaches to bot management: Static, Challenge-based, and Behavioral.
Static approach uses static analysis tools to identify web requests and header information that active and known malicious bots are reported to use. This technique is effective in detecting bad bots that are already recorded and known.
Challenge-based approach uses active challenges or tests that are difficult or impossible for bots to perform.
Behavioral approach evaluates the activity of potential users and matches that activity against known patterns to verify user identity.
A solution like Radware Bot Manager uses behavioral modeling, collective bot intelligence, and fingerprinting to accurately detect and mitigate bot threats. With a range of mitigation options, including a unique Crypto Challenge, it allows legitimate users to browse without CAPTCHAs while still thwarting bot attacks. Radware Bot Manager’s comprehensive protection includes secure identity and device and app attestation for native iOS and Android mobile applications to ensure accurate and effective protection against identity spoofing, identity tampering, and replay attacks. It also prevents mobile emulators, modified applications, and modified mobile operating systems from accessing resources.
Key Components of a Bot Management System
An effective bot management solution has several key components: detection, identification, response, and monitoring:
Detection: Involves identifying bot traffic on a website or application. This can be done through various methods such as analyzing web requests, header information, and user behavior.
Identification: The categorization of the detected bot traffic as either good or bad can be done through techniques such as machine learning, behavioral analysis, and fingerprinting.
Response: The process of taking appropriate action based on the identified bot traffic can include blocking malicious bots while still allowing useful bots to access web properties.
Monitoring: The continuous tracking of bot activity to ensure that the bot management solution is effectively protecting against malicious bots and allowing useful bots to operate uninterrupted.
These components work together to provide comprehensive protection against automated threats. By accurately detecting and identifying bot traffic, responding appropriately to block malicious bots while allowing useful bots to operate, and continuously monitoring bot activity, an effective bot management solution can protect digital assets and maintain a secure environment for businesses.
Detection and Identification
Bot management solutions like Radware Bot Manager use advanced technologies and techniques to accurately detect and identify bots. These include behavioral analysis, IP reputation, device fingerprinting, and collective bot intelligence.
Behavioral analysis involves evaluating the activity of potential users and matching that activity against known patterns to verify user identity. This can include analyzing mouse movements, scrolling behavior, and other user interactions to distinguish between human and bot behavior.
IP reputation involves checking the reputation of the IP addresses associated with web requests to determine if they are associated with known malicious bots. This can be done by checking against blacklists of known bad IP addresses or by analyzing the history of activity associated with an IP address.
Device fingerprinting involves collecting information about the device being used to access a web property to determine if it is associated with known malicious bots. This can include information such as the device’s operating system, browser type, and installed fonts.
Collective bot intelligence involves sharing information about known malicious bots across a network of protected web properties to improve the accuracy of bot detection and identification.
Leveraging these advanced technologies and techniques allows bot management solutions like Radware Bot Manager to accurately detect and identify bots to provide comprehensive protection against automated threats.
Response and Monitoring
Once bot management solutions like Radware Bot Manager have detected and identified bots, they take appropriate actions to respond to the bot traffic. These actions can include blocking malicious bots, rate limiting bot traffic, or serving alternate content to bots.
Blocking involves preventing malicious bots from accessing a web property. This can be done by blocking the IP addresses associated with the bots or by using other techniques such as JavaScript challenges or CAPTCHAs.
Rate limiting involves limiting the rate at which bots can access a web property. This can help prevent performance impacts on the site by ensuring that bot traffic does not overload the servers.
Serving alternate content to bots involves serving different content to bots than to human users. This can be used to prevent bots from scraping protected content or to serve them content that is specifically designed for bots. Radware Bot Manager has a “Feed Fake Data” response option that helps e-commerce websites conceal their real pricing from scraper bots deployed by competitors.
Continuous monitoring and updating of bot management solutions is important to ensure that they remain effective against evolving bot threats. As new malicious bots are developed and deployed, bot management solutions must be updated to accurately detect and identify them. By continuously monitoring bot activity and updating their detection and identification techniques, bot management solutions can provide ongoing protection against automated threats.

Operation: Search engine bots crawl websites and collect information to create an index that helps search engines serve relevant results to users.
Potential Impact: Positive - Search engine bots enable users to find the information they need quickly. They also drive organic traffic to websites, boosting their visibility and potential revenue.
It is essential to maintain a balance and ensure ethical use of bots in the digital environment. While good bots can bring numerous benefits, they need to operate within legal and ethical boundaries to avoid potential negative impacts such as privacy violations, misinformation, or the manipulation of user perceptions. Proper regulation and continuous monitoring are necessary to harness the full potential of good bots while minimizing any adverse consequences.
Types of Bad Bots
Bad bots are programmed to execute malicious activities with detrimental impacts on websites and online platforms. Here are some main types of bad bots and their potential impact:
Web Scrapers
Web scrapers are bots that crawl websites to extract data, often without permission. While not all web scrapers are malicious, some can overload a website's server, leading to performance issues and increased server costs.
Credential Stuffing Bots
These bots attempt to log in to user accounts using stolen credentials from data breaches. If successful, they can gain unauthorized access to user accounts, leading to identity theft, fraud, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Bots
DDoS bots flood a website's server with an overwhelming amount of traffic, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. This can result in downtime, loss of revenue, and damage to a website's reputation.
Spam Bots
Spam bots post unsolicited advertisements, links, or malicious content on forums, comment sections, and social media. This can annoy users, reduce the quality of user-generated content, and potentially lead to phishing attacks.
Price Scraping Bots
These bots scrape pricing information from e-commerce websites and undercut the prices to steal business from competitors. This can harm businesses and distort the market.
Social Media Bots
Social media bots are automated accounts designed to amplify specific content or engage in manipulative activities like spreading misinformation. They can influence public opinion, deceive users, and contribute to the spread of fake news.
Content Scrapers
Content scrapers copy and repost content from websites, sometimes without proper attribution. This can harm the original website's SEO rankings and traffic, as well as devalue the content creator's work.
Skimming Bots
Skimming bots are used to steal payment card information from e-commerce websites. This data can be used for fraudulent transactions, leading to financial losses for both customers and businesses.
Click Fraud Bots
Click fraud bots artificially inflate the number of clicks on pay-per-click (PPC) ads or affiliate links to generate revenue for the bot operator. This can lead to financial losses for advertisers and disrupt the accuracy of ad campaign metrics.
Malware Distribution Bots
Bots are used to spread malware and malicious links. This can infect users' devices, steal data, and compromise security.
How to Effectively Manage Bots
Managing bots effectively involves striking a balance between allowing beneficial bots to operate while blocking or limiting harmful bots. Key strategies are:
1.Identify Good vs. Bad Bots: The first step is to distinguish between good bots (like search engine crawlers) and bad bots (such as scrapers and DDoS bots). Implement a bot management solution that can accurately classify bot traffic based on behavior, user agent, and other characteristics.
2.Set Up a Robots.txt File: Implement a robots.txt file to communicate with good bots and instruct them on how to interact with your website. This file can help control access to specific areas of your website and prevent certain bots from crawling sensitive pages.
3.CAPTCHAs and Challenges: Implement CAPTCHAs and other challenges during the registration or log-in process to ensure that real users can access your site while discouraging automated bot attacks.
4.Rate Limiting: Apply rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user agent within a specific time frame. This helps prevent data scraping and DDoS attacks from overwhelming your server.
5.IP Blocking and Blacklisting: Maintain a database of known malicious IP addresses and use IP blocking or blacklisting to prevent them from accessing your website.
6.Behavior Analysis: Use behavioral analysis to identify abnormal patterns and characteristics associated with bots. Machine learning algorithms can help detect previously unseen bot behaviors.
7.Device Fingerprinting: Employ device fingerprinting techniques to recognize and block bots that attempt to change user agent strings or IP addresses to evade detection.
8.Human Interaction Challenges: Implement challenges that require human-like interactions, such as drag-and-drop puzzles or mouse movement simulations, to thwart advanced bots.

The Importance of Holistic Security Solutions Encompassing On-prem and Cloud Services in Today’s Complicated Attack Landscape
Preface
In my last Blog post (“Ensuring your DDoS solutions stays cost-effective despite the ever-evolving business environment”) we have established that the Cyber landscape is growing rapidly, with more services transitioning into digital and with that – more new and innovative digital services being created. This, in turn, increases the cyber-attack surface and creates considerable challenges for organizations to protect their business.
In the previous Blog post, I chose to focus on “staying cost-effective,” an important consideration by itself.
In this Blog post, I will focus on choosing a security solution that is holistic and comprehensive enough to keep your business always protected and against multitude of attacks, varying in volume and vectors. Let us dive into it…
The attack landscape: the attacker’s candy jar
Attacks can be grouped into several categories, and so do the tools that counter-measure the attacks and mitigate them. Focusing on network and application-level attacks, we can identify the following categories:
Volumetric attacks: focusing on the volume of traffic directed at the attacked entity. Those are typically L3/L4 (in the OSI model) attacks. These can further split into attacks targeting a specific server (IP/URL) or service or network wide attacks that are targeting a whole network prefix or part of it (e.g., a “/24”) and can result also in “carpet bombing” attacks.
Application (L7) attacks: these attacks are more focused on the application and its behavior, business-logic, structure, and code itself. They typically result in cross-site scripting (XSS), inventory scraping, identity theft, APIs attack, etc.
Network L7 DDoS attacks: those attacks are typically targeting the L7 network protocols used to communicate with the applications / services. Those protocols would typically be HTTP, HTTPS SSL, TLS, with the more sophisticated attacks targeting TLS specifically by obfuscating the attack inside of the TLS itself. With TLS being an encrypted protocol, this creates an even bigger challenge for attack detection and mitigation solutions to detect the attack and mitigate it. DNS attacks are also gaining more popularity with “DNS dictionary” and “DNS water torture” attacks” at the forefront.
One characteristic of L7 attacks *network or application) is that they do not necessarily result in large volume of traffic aimed at the attacked entity but rather the attacks are sophisticated and can result in lower volumes (sometimes referred to as “low and slow”).
There are additional attack types, but these are enough to show the numerous possibilities and vectors to attack an organization and its business. As I said – the attacker’s “candy jar.”
An important note to add is that if you are not well educated and familiar with the attack landscape, you would be amazed of how easy it is to become an attacker! Tools are readily available in various Internet sources and are quite cheap to purchase and to operate. This makes the life of an attacker quite easy and the life of a legitimate organization, trying to protect itself, quite challenging.
If you got this far – you are highly likely to understand the scope of attacks that your organization and business can experience, and that proper planning and strategy is required to ensure your organization is well covered and protected against the attacks that it might experience
Deploying & consuming a cyber-security solution – a sea of options
With the growth of digital transformation and cyber-attack possibilities, the options to deploy and/or consume cyber-security solutions also grew. Here are typical examples.
Consuming a cyber-security service from one’s service provider: organizations are typically consuming their Internet, as well as communication (landlines as well as cellular) from well-known service providers. In recent years, service providers have also added cyber-security services to their offering. For a typical organization, this means that instead of purchasing the equipment and deploying it on-premises, the organization can instead subscribe to a cyber-security service offered by the organization’s service provider. The service provider purchases the equipment, the peripherals and labor to maintain the service and equipment. The organization – simply pays to consume the service and be protected.
A combination – on-premises with cloud expansion: this option combines the deployment of on-premises equipment (owned by the organization itself) and the ability to expand to a cloud service, owned by a professional cyber-security cloud service provider. This approach is typically used when an organization wants to or needs to mitigate some of the attacks / attack volume on premise but also needs to ability to expand to cloud services in case the attack volume overcomes the on-premises capacity or if the attack becomes far more complicated for the on-premises equipment to handle. In this case, the organization can enjoy the benefits of both “worlds”.
Consuming a cyber-security service from a well-known cloud provider: this option is typically similar to the one above with an important difference that now the service is provided by a dedicated cyber-security cloud provider (such as Radware), which specializes in providing dedicated cyber-security protections and, as in the case of Radware, also develops and produces the actual cyber-security devices used to protect the organizations. Typically, dedicated cyber-security cloud providers provide the utmost professional services in the market.
On-Premises deployment: this means that the protected organization purchases all the necessary equipment and deploys it in its own organization’s datacenter or scrubbing-center. It also means that the organization is responsible for hiring skilled security personnel and accompanying peripherals such as routers, switches, landlines with appropriate throughput to absorb the attack volume.
There are pros and cons to each of the above approaches. Here are some of them:
Deploying on-premises only: enables the organization to completely control the exceptionally fine details of its attack protection policy and capabilities. If the organization has the proper skillset and labor – the organization can fine-tune its protection policies as well as keep up to speed as those change. There are also exceptionally large enterprises owning exceptionally large networks; these organizations will typically not want to pass through yet another network, as their network is large on its own. Lastly, some organizations cannot allow their data (traffic) to move out of the organization’s perimeters and on to the cloud. Thus – on-premises solutions are optimal in such cases. The cons of this approach are that the organization needs to hire experienced cyber-security personnel as well as to purchase the equipment itself (e.g., Capex).
Consuming cyber-security from a service-provider or a dedicated cloud provider: means that the organization does not have to spend Capex (no need to purchase equipment) and can go with Opex. In addition, the organization does not have to hire experienced cyber-security personnel, a task that is becoming ever more challenging over time. The Cons are that the organization needs to move its data to the cloud and rely on others to ensure it is always protected.
If you got this far – you understand that a holistic cyber-security solution requires coverage for the attack types that you may experience (volumetric L3/L4, L7 network, application, DNS…) combined with the proper deployment methodology suiting your organization the best (on-premises, cloud service or hybrid…)
As in life – there are no perfect solutions and it all boils down to one’s needs, preferences, restrictions, and constraints. But – it is up to you – the organization – to make the right choice for your business.
Choosing the appropriate cyber-security solution – considerations
As a rule of thumb, we at Radware recommend that your organization runs a thorough review of your your security needs, internal workforce capabilities, budget, and company policies (desires, constraints, and restrictions) so that you can decide on the most optimal, effective, and cost-efficient cyber-security solution for you.
Having said the above, here are a few guidelines to help you determine which solution is appropriate for you.
Do not underestimate application protection: Obviously, if your organization does not deploy applications at all then this is not necessary. However, most organizations in today’s business landscape do own and deploy applications, be it to serve their customers and / or to serve their own employes. If that is the case in your organization – you must also deploy application protection in the form of Web Application Firewalls (WAF), WAAP – Web and API protection, Bot Management protections, L7 network DDoS protections. As for deployment policy, Radware recommends deploying the network L7 DDoS protections on-premises while WAF, WAAP and Bot-management and advanced webDDoS solutions to be consumed as a service from Radware’s cloud. Application-level attacks are becoming extraordinarily complex and are employing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) engines and algorithms. As such, the mitigating solutions also use AI and ML. AI and ML typically require heavy computing resources, which could turn an on-premises solution to be quite expensive for an organization to own and deploy. By having those consumed by a professional cyber-security cloud owner, the organization benefits from a best-in-class solution, which is also cost-effective.
Reliant on APIs? Do not overlook this section: if you deploy services that offer APIs, either to your own employees or to your customers, it is super important that you deploy a WAAP (Web and API protection) solution. APIs are typically the biggest vulnerabilities of organizations. Even to date, developers are overlooking API “engineering excellence” and are not developing APIs with security in mind. This is reality. Overlooking this is a mistake. Radware recommends that you deploy / subscribe to a WAAP solution which will ensure your APIs are protected at all times!
Network volumetric protection is necessary: while the attack landscape is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with advanced application layer attacks, network volumetric attacks are going nowhere and are not reduced in usage nor volumes at all. Organizations must deploy or consume solutions to protect their networks at the perimeter / edge from being overwhelmed. If your organization seeks complete control over the network protection and has the resources – Radware recommends that you purchase and deploy a DDoS solution on-premises. If your budget is short of spending considerable Capex in advance and/or your in-house expertise is short, Radware offers its professional, best of breed, cloud DDoS solutions. You could also enjoy the “hybrid” strategy, where your organization will deploy a solution on-premises but also purchase “the right” to divert traffic to the Radware cloud in case attacks supersede your on-premises capacity to mitigate. This strategy lets one enjoy both worlds while keeping the overall cost of the solution effective.
Summary
The attack landscape is indeed extraordinarily complex and full of various attack vectors. The importance of a true comprehensive cyber-security solution is imperative. Network (volumetric) attacks go nowhere but application-targeting attacks, be it at the networking level (L7 protocols), or the targeting of the application itself, are becoming increasingly dominant. A comprehensive and inclusive cyber-security solution should protect your network and applications. It should be deployed and/or consumed (Cloud SaaS) in accordance with your organization’s policies, budget, and needs. Failing to attend to one piece of the cyber-security protection puzzle will leave you vulnerable and susceptible to attacks.

SOC Insider Reveals: Why We Dumped Rate Limits for Next-Gen Security!
Introduction
In the fast-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, staying ahead of threats is paramount. As a Radware product manager who specializes in DDoS attacks, I have witnessed a groundbreaking shift within our Security Operations Center (SOC).
This blog unveils the journey of abandoning traditional rate limits in favor of next-gen security measures. Join me as I shed light on the motivations, challenges, and the strategy we have embraced.
What is Rate Limiting?
Rate limiting is a cybersecurity mechanism employed to control and manage traffic flow to a network or web application, particularly in the face of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
This mechanism restricts traffic that exceeded a certain threshold and can be implemented through various metrics such as:
Connections Per Second (CPS)
Packets Per Second (PPS)
Bandwidth (Gbps)
Administrators set predefined thresholds for the above metrics, allowing them to proactively prevent network congestion, safeguard against sudden spikes in traffic, and efficiently manage incoming traffic.
The Pitfalls of Rate Limiting
In this section, we delve into the specific pitfalls that led our SOC to reevaluate its reliance on rate limiting.
Ineffectiveness Against Complex Attacks
DDoS attack methodologies have evolved into complex, multi-vector, dynamic and adaptive strategies, rendering traditional rate limits less effective. Attackers now employ techniques that manipulate traffic patterns, mimic legitimate traffic, making it challenging for rate limits to keep pace. The reactive nature of rate limiting, relying on predefined thresholds, often falls short in identifying and mitigating these dynamic attacks in real-time.
Example Scenario:
Imagine a scenario where a DDoS attack launches a low-and-slow attack, carefully avoiding rate limits by gradually increasing the attack intensity. Traditional rate limits struggle to detect such subtle variations, leaving security teams blind to the impending threat until it reaches a critical point.
Impact on Legitimate Traffic
Rate limiting operates on predefined thresholds, reacting to the volume of incoming traffic. This reactive approach puts security teams in a perpetual game of catch-up. By the time rate limits identify and respond to an ongoing attack, considerable damage may have already occurred, leading to potential service disruptions, and compromised user experiences.
Real-world Impact:
Turning Away Website Visitors:
Rate limiting, in managing traffic, may accidentally limit potential website visitors. Beyond a specific traffic threshold, new connections get blocked. During flash crowds, like the surge in online shoppers on Black Friday, this threshold, while essential for security, can unintentionally block user access, impacting the overall experience and damaging sales.
Decreasing Conversion Rates:
Rate limiting does not just limit visitors during an attack; it also makes the website slower for those already there. This can be frustrating for users and make their experience less than ideal. As a result, fewer users might purchase items, sign up, or engage with the site.
Ineffectiveness in Blocking Malicious Traffic
Rate limiting, while shaping the overall traffic volume, falls short in its primary objective of distinguishing between legitimate and malicious traffic. As a mechanism that limits the rate of incoming traffic, it lacks the sophistication needed to effectively identify and mitigate malicious traffic. This limitation underscores the critical need for a more intelligent approach to security.
Endless configuration maintenance on SOC operations
Rate limiting not only struggles to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic but also introduces a maintenance challenge for the SOC team. SOC teams face the ongoing task of tracking and fine-tuning configurations and thresholds regularly. This continuous effort is necessary to adapt to changes in user behavior, evolving traffic patterns, and emerging cyber threats. The need for constant attention and manual adjustments highlights the limitations of relying solely on rate limiting.
The Evolution to Behavioral Protections
In recognizing these pitfalls, our SOC team confronted the need for a more intelligent, proactive, and adaptable defense strategy. The shortcomings of rate limiting prompted a critical reassessment of our security posture, leading to the adoption of advanced behavioral protections that could effectively counter the challenges posed by dynamic and evolving DDoS attacks.
Benefits of Behavioral Protections
Behavioral protection is a sophisticated approach that goes beyond traditional methods, leveraging machine learning to detect and mitigate anomalies based on learned patterns of legitimate traffic.
As we step into the world of advanced cybersecurity, the advantages of behavioral protections take center stage, reshaping our defense strategy.
Now, let us explore the key benefits that make the behavioral protections stand out:
Adaptive Defense and Business Continuity:
The standout feature of behavioral protection lies in their enhanced adaptability, countering the dynamic nature of modern DDoS attacks, and consistently learning from customer traffic to automatically fine-tune the baselines. This adaptability enhances the security infrastructure, translating to an improved user experience and sustained business continuity, while also assisting the SOC team in focusing on critical tasks.
Reduce Time to Mitigate:
Behavioral protections not only enhance accuracy and adaptability but also offer a crucial advantage in reducing the time it takes to mitigate potential threats. Operating in real-time, these measures swiftly identify and respond to emerging threats, minimizing the impact of attacks immediately.
Enhanced Accuracy and Minimal Disruptions:
Behavioral protection represents a significant leap in our security measures. Unlike conventional rate limiting, they leverage machine learning to accurately identify malicious activity based on the legitimate traffic learning. This proactive approach substantially reduces false positives, ensuring minimal disruptions for legitimate users while swiftly pinpointing potential threats.
Conclusion
While rate limiting served as a foundational defense, its pitfalls, including ineffectiveness against complex attacks, impact on legitimate traffic, and endless configuration maintenance, prompted our transition. Behavioral protections emerged as the solution, offering enhanced accuracy, adaptability, and reduced time to mitigate threats. This evolution not only strengthens our security posture but signifies a commitment to innovation, ensuring business continuity, and empowering SOC teams to focus on critical tasks.

Real-time “Under Attack” Visualization: Designing Intuitive Dashboards for Maximum Security
In the dynamic landscape of cybersecurity, the ability to quickly identify, understand, and respond to threats cannot be overstated. As the volume and complexity of cyber threats continue to increase, the role of effective data visualization in cybersecurity dashboards becomes crucial. These dashboards serve as the cockpit dashboard interface, empowering users to understand the data and make informed decisions rapidly.
The Importance of Real-time Threat Visualization
Cybersecurity professionals operate in an environment where split-second decisions can mitigate or escalate potential threats. However, navigating through a multitude of security data, such as intrusion attempts, malware outbreaks, or anomalous activities, can be overwhelming without the aid of well-designed visualization tools.
Enabling Rapid Decision-Making
A well-crafted cybersecurity dashboard should not just display data but should transform it into actionable insights. It must convert complex information into easily digestible visual representations, enabling users to understand the state of their systems swiftly.
Effective Data Visualization Techniques
Clarity and Simplicity
The most important rule of effective data visualization is clarity. A cluttered or overly complex interface can confuse rather than assist decision-making. Clear and simple visuals that convey the most critical information at a glance are invaluable.

Hierarchical Information Display
Prioritizing information based on its relevance and urgency is crucial. Using visual hierarchies, such as color-coded alerts or size-based emphasis, guides users to focus on the most critical threats first.

Interactive Elements for Deeper Insights
Offering interactive elements within the dashboard allows users to investigate deeper when necessary. For instance, clickable elements or drill-down features enable a more in-depth view of specific threats without overwhelming the initial dashboard view.

Real-time Updates and Alerts
Incorporating real-time data updates and instantaneous alerts ensures that cybersecurity professionals are equipped with the most current information, enabling proactive responses to emerging threats.

Understanding User Needs
Designing a cybersecurity dashboard begins with understanding the users’ needs, their workflows, and the contexts in which they operate. A user-centric approach ensures that the dashboard aligns with their use, making it more intuitive and efficient.
Conclusion
In an era defined by persistent cyber threats, the design of cybersecurity dashboards plays an important role. Real-time threat visualization isn’t just about presenting data; it’s about empowering users with the tools to make split-second decisions effectively. By employing clear, intuitive, and user-centric design principles, cybersecurity dashboards become a major advantage in the ongoing battle against evolving cyber threats.
Ultimately, the success of a cybersecurity dashboard lies in its ability to seamlessly merge powerful data insights with an intuitive user experience, empowering the users to stay one step ahead.

Understanding the DDoS Threat Landscape
Before delving into the combined approach, it is crucial to understand the DDoS threat landscape:
Scale and Impact: DDoS attacks can disrupt online services, damage reputations, and result in significant financial losses.
Variety of Attack Vectors: DDoS attacks come in various forms, including volumetric attacks that flood network bandwidth, application layer attacks that target specific services, and multi-vector attacks that combine multiple techniques.
Changing Attack Patterns: Attackers continuously adapt and modify their tactics, making it challenging to predict and defend against their next move.
The Role of On-Premises DDoS Mitigation
On-premises DDoS mitigation is essential for several reasons:
Low Latency: By mitigating attacks at the network edge, on-premises solutions ensure minimal latency for legitimate traffic, preserving the quality of service.
Immediate Traffic Scrubbing: On-premises DDoS mitigation appliances can scrub malicious traffic at the network perimeter before it reaches your internal infrastructure, in addition it does not require any scrubbing diversion which adds a delay.
Privacy: On-premises mitigation allows organizations to retain control over sensitive data, ensuring that it never leaves the network.
The Role of Cloud-Based DDoS Mitigation
Cloud-based DDoS mitigation complements on-premises solutions in several ways:
Scalability: Cloud-based mitigation services can absorb massive traffic volumes during large-scale attacks, preventing network saturation.
Specialized Expertise: Cloud providers often have dedicated security teams with deep expertise in DDoS attack mitigation.
Global Reach: Cloud providers have distributed scrubbing centers worldwide, allowing for a geographically diverse defense against attacks.
Cost-Effective: Pay-as-you-go pricing models offered by cloud providers reduce the cost of maintaining on-premises capacity for large-scale attacks.
The Role of DDoS SOAR
DDoS SOAR adds orchestration, automation, and response capabilities to the combined solution:
Automated Attack Detection: DDoS SOAR solutions continuously monitor network traffic and automatically detect deviations indicative of DDoS attacks.
Immediate Mitigation: When an attack is detected, DDoS SOAR can automate the orchestration of on-premises and cloud-based mitigation measures, ensuring immediate and effective response.
Intelligent Decision-Making: DDoS SOAR uses threat intelligence and analytics to make informed decisions about traffic diversion, filtering, and response actions.

Ensuring Your DDoS Solutions Stays Cost-Effective Despite the Ever-Evolving Business Environment

One thing is certain about the Cyber landscape: it never rests! The Cyber landscape is constantly evolving and changing and with it also cyber security. The digital transformation that has swept the world since a few years ago, but mainly during COVID-19, has transformed many of the services and products that we consume to be digitally based (e.g., online) as opposed to physical (being served by a human being) or phone-based. While digital transformation has its obvious merits, it also increases the exposure to cyber-attacks, both for businesses as well as for individuals. Attackers never rest. They come up with new attack vectors and methods. The good thing is that cyber-security vendors do not rest as well. We come up with innovative ways to counter new and evolving attacks. The question that you should ask yourself, as a business owner, is “Am I never resting? Am I always up to speed with the latest updated solutions to protect me from cyber-attacks harming my business?” But most important, are you doing so cost-effectively?
In this blog post, we will highlight key points to help you select a DDoS solution that allows your business to grow and scale while staying cost-effective.
Starting small while ensuring cost-effective scale
Being cost-effective is obviously about purchasing and deploying exactly what you need to protect your business. Not less, and not more. But what happens when your business grows? Is your DDoS solution flexible enough to allow cost-effective business growth?
Here are a few examples:
Business growth: A small business starts with 2 DDoS mitigation devices (active-standby), managed by a single management (SOC operations) solution, able to protect against DDoS attacks of up to 5Gb. 12 to 18 months later, your business grows substantially, coupled with an exponential growth of digital services that you provide to your clients. You then realize that you need to increase your DDoS protection coverage by as much as 3-4 times. You need to ask yourself – is my initial solution capable of simply adding 4-5 more identical DDoS mitigation devices? Will my management & orchestration system be able to cope with the additional flex of telemetry data? Or will my vendor tell me that I need to replace my management system or increase HW capacity, which will lead to increasing my solution’s overall cost for no good reason.
New attack vectors: What happens if a new attack vector is becoming more popular with attackers (say – DNS or TLS attacks or new malicious IPs)? Is my vendor capable of effectively mitigating these new vectors? And how will I consume these new protections? Via a SW upgrade? A mere change of license? Or should I replace my underlying HW (mitigation devices and/or management devices)?
The two examples above emphasize the importance of selecting a DDoS solution that will allow us the most cost-effective growth and scale even if we are not fundamentally changing our deployment architecture.
Cost-effectively changing deployment mode – Inline to out-of-path
This section discusses business growth that mandates a change in the DDoS solution deployment architecture to stay cost-effective.
Let us assume that you are a small to medium sized service provider, with 6 active edge routers. You decide to protect your business against DDoS attacks by deploying 6 pairs of DDoS detection / mitigation devices in inline mode. Time goes by and your business successfully grows. You now own some 20 edge routers. You need to protect all of them from DDoS attacks. However – your analysis shows that merely increasing the number of DDoS mitigation devices by 14 additional pairs is going to be overly expensive for you. Just the mere cost of adding 14 pairs of DDoS devices is too expensive, not even considering the cost of overall management, maintenance and staff increase. You ask yourself: “is there another way, far more cost-effective for me to provide proper DDoS protection to my growing business?”
As it happens – there is such an option, and it is called “out of path” or OOP. OOP means that instead of deploying a DDoS device next to each of your edge routers, you now deploy a group of far fewer devices in a central location in your network. In addition, you rely on a piece of SW that consumes NetFlow statistics from each of the relevant routers as well as on a central automation & orchestration SW that receives all of the NetFlow indications, decides if there is an ongoing attack, which one, where (which router / segment), on what (destinations, applications) and, as a result, decides, real-time, which DDoS mitigation device to activate to effectively block the DDoS attack.
Switching from an inline to an OOP deployment architecture can literally save your DDoS protection strategy as it allows you to continue staying cost-effective even when your business grows.
There are critical questions that you should ask yourself before selecting a DDoS vendor when you know or assume that you may have to switch from inline to OOP at some point in time:
Is my vendor proposing at all OOP solutions? If not, the cost of transitioning from one vendor to another can be overwhelming.
What is the level of automation & orchestration that my vendor offers in his OOP solution? OOP DDoS solutions require, by nature, a great level of dynamic changes during the lifecycle of an attack. The last thing you want is to be forced to apply those changes manually. This means more headcount (handling the changes) and more exposure to human errors – all resulting in far less cost-effective business.
Is transitioning from inline to OOP mandates a change of the mitigation devices (HW) or a change of the management solutions (SW)? (adding, “throwing”, replacing)? Or is it simply a change of license or SW upgrade? Obviously, any HW or SW that is added, thrown, or replaced is a step back from being cost-effective.
Expanding your DDoS solution to the cloud
Let’s assume that your organization deploys an on-premise DDoS solution and that this solution can definitely mitigate the level of DDoS attacks your organization suffered from in the past. Six to 12 months go by, and suddenly you start seeing a steep rise in the number of attacks and the size of the attacks your organization is suffering from. Your current, on-premise, DDoS solution cannot mitigate the overall volume of these attacks. A quick analysis of the overall additional spending that you will have to do to deal with the new volume of attacks has proven to be beyond your current budget. As an alternative, you consider expending your DDoS solution to the cloud by licensing “over the top” DDoS cloud services from your DDoS vendor. There are a few questions that you should ask yourself (well…should have asked yourself initially):
Does my DDoS vendor offer cloud expansion services at all? If not, then the cost of complementing your DDoS solution with perpetual, self-owned complementary equipment can be overly expensive for you. Alternatively, switching to another DDoS vendor who does offer complementary cloud services, can be equally as expensive.
Even if my vendor does offer DDoS cloud services – what is required to onboard these services? Does it mean that I must replace some or all my on-prem equipment? Buy more on-prem equipment?
In some cases, vendors who offer cloud complementary DDoS services offer this through partnering with a 3rd party cloud DDoS provider. You should ask yourself then if your original DDoS provider is still your prime and only contact for all things DDoS related, or do you have to onboard and manage an additional vendor?
All the above has direct implications on the overall cost of expanding your DDoS solutions to the cloud as well.
Expanding your business to protect others – becoming an MSSP
As a service provider or a large enterprise, you often find that there is a business need and a justification to protect your tenants against DDoS attacks. It means that you are becoming an MSSP (managed security service provider). But such an ability requires dedicated systems that allow complete separation between your own and tenant assets and between each tenant’s assets. It also requires the ability to grant your tenants control of their own assets and actions but with limitations to ensure they do not harm the overall system. The above are just a few of the requirements and considerations of becoming an MSSP. The questions that you should ask yourself, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, are:
Does my current (or intended) vendor offer such MSSP capabilities for me to add at any given point in time? If not – this may force you to completely change your DDoS vendor and end up in a non-cost-effective overall business.
Is the MSSP solution that my DDoS vendor offers require heavy lifting in the form of adding substantial HW? Different SW modules? Reeducation of my DDoS staff? Or is it only a SW upgrade or merely the addition of a license and “magic…” the MSSP option is added?
What is the overall cost of purchasing (adding) and maintaining the MSSP portion and is that economically viable Vs. the projected revenue? At Radware, we think that it is our responsibility to also ensure that we provide you with solutions that allow you to scale to meet your customer’s needs profitably.

Anonymous Proxies: The Double-Edged Sword of Online Privacy

Introduction
In today’s digital age, where an individual’s every online action can leave a lasting footprint, the importance of online privacy and security cannot be overstated. Various tools and technologies have been developed to protect users’ privacy, among which anonymous proxies stand out as both enigmatic and essential. This blog aims to demystify the complex world of anonymous proxies, offering an in-depth understanding of their functionalities, types, and use-cases. By shedding light on how these proxies operate to mask your identity and shield your data, we will arm you with the knowledge you need to navigate the digital world more safely and confidently. Whether you are an individual looking to protect personal information or a business aiming to secure digital assets, this blog will serve as your comprehensive guide to understanding and leveraging anonymous proxies for enhanced online security.
What is an Anonymous Proxy?
Anonymous proxies serve as intermediaries between users and the internet. By masking the user’s IP address and filtering incoming data, these proxies make online activities less traceable. This layer of anonymity provides a shield against unauthorized access, enabling users to navigate the web incognito.
The Advantages of Staying Anonymous
The ability to stay anonymous online offers individuals a shield of privacy, safeguarding personal information from prying eyes and potential threats. This newfound sense of security extends to activities like secure web browsing, ensuring confidential transactions, and protecting sensitive data. Anonymity can empower users to freely access geo-restricted content, fostering a more open and unrestricted online experience.

Anonymous Proxy during attack time
In most of our customers’ peace time traffic, we observe that only about 2% of all network traffic is sourced from anonymous proxies. However, during suspected attack scenarios, the anonymous proxies rate dramatically increases to between 50% and 75% of the total incoming traffic. This is a significant indicator that an attack might be underway, although it is crucial to note that this parameter alone is not sufficient to definitively conclude an attack is happening.
To increase the reliability of attack detection, we recommend combining anonymous proxy rate with other parameters like geolocation. For instance, if a surge in anonymous proxy traffic is paired with unusual geolocation patterns, this combination could bolster the validity of attack detection.
That said, it is essential to consider the nature of the website being protected. Some websites, such as gambling, streaming websites, or adult-content platforms, naturally attract a larger portion of legitimate traffic from anonymous proxies. In such cases, a high rate of anonymous proxy traffic may not be a reliable indicator of an attack. Therefore, a nuanced approach that considers multiple factors is necessary for effective security monitoring and incident response.
By incorporating these multi-faceted analytics into our security solutions, Radware provides a robust and comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating potential security incidents.
Advanced Threat Tactics: Case of Anonymous Sudan [*1]
Anonymous Sudan utilizes a sophisticated strategy involving cloud-rented virtual private servers to establish a centrally orchestrated bot infrastructure. In the attacks against Denmark, for example, the group employed 61 high-capacity cloud servers hosted in IBM Cloud. These servers were capable of generating HTTPS request floods at staggering rates, ranging from 800,000 to 2 million Requests Per Second (RPS). To obfuscate its infrastructure and complicate detection efforts, Anonymous Sudan employs a rotating set of proxy and SOCKS servers [*2], which makes it appear as if the attacks are originating from multiple locations. There are also services that provide an enormous number of anonymous proxies, with 10 to 20% of their IP addresses changing daily, making high-scale encrypted HTTPS attacks appear to originate from hundreds of thousands of different IPs. The duration of these attacks varies, lasting from a few minutes to several hours.
It is worth noting that there have been even larger-scale attacks recorded by other organizations such as Google, Akamai, and Cloudflare. For instance, Cloudflare reported a hyperscale attack in February 2023 that peaked at 71 million RPS. However, these attacks only last for a few seconds to a few minutes. In contrast, the attacks we observed from Anonymous Sudan did not exceed 1.8 million RPS, but they maintain this high level for an extended period.
Additionally, Anonymous Sudan diversifies its attack techniques by alternating HTTPS attack waves with UDP and SYN floods. These floods originate from approximately 10,000 unique source IPs and can reach up to 600 Gbps. Moreover, the HTTPS connection floods are further enhanced by leveraging HTTP/1.1 connection pipelining and HTTP/2 multiplexing. They also employ a Content Delivery Network (CDN) cut-through technique by appending random characters to each request. The infrastructure for these attacks involves the same SOCKS network used for HTTPS attacks, and the servers used range from those running Squid in a forward proxy configuration on Ubuntu to compromised Mikrotik routers with SOCKS enabled.
This example underscores the growing complexity of threat actors who consistently refine their tactics, employing anonymous proxies for targeted attacks. Consequently, ongoing vigilance coupled with adaptive security strategies is essential for a robust cybersecurity defense.
Summary
Radware employes various techniques in its core algorithms to make sure proxy obfuscated bad actors would still be flagged as attackers and will be blocked. Of course, that cannot happen based on IP alone given that the IP is the proxy IP and may be serving other legitimate clients. Radware behavioral BDoS and as well as Radware unique Web DDoS mitigation algorithms are agnostic to proxies and provide perfect protection for this scenario.

[*2]: Types of Anonymous Proxies
HTTPS Proxies (Secure and Versatile):
HTTPS proxies are designed for secure web browsing and encrypting data between the user and the proxy server. They excel in safeguarding online transactions and sensitive information. Additionally, they can interpret and filter data packets, making them suitable for content filtering and web data caching.
SOCKS4 Proxies (Flexible but Limited in Security):
SOCKS4 proxies are versatile and handle various network traffic types, but they lack user authentication. They offer privacy and are used for content streaming and bypassing geo-restrictions. However, their security is lower due to the absence of authentication.
SOCKS5 Proxies (Highly Secure and Versatile):
SOCKS5 proxies provide enhanced security, supporting both TCP and UDP connections. They are versatile, compatible with various traffic types, and offer authentication for added security.

3 Ways of Protecting Your Public Cloud Against DDoS Attacks
“DDoS? In the public cloud? That is not a problem.”
Well, not quite.
Although many IT professionals see DDoS attacks as a thing of the past, a new generation of sophisticated DDoS attacks is challenging traditional anti-DDoS defenses, and leading to bigger, more complex, and more damaging attacks than ever before.
This is true even in the public cloud, where many organizations mistakenly think that the public cloud provider will take care of it for them. But with the shift of DDoS attacks to the application-layer, network-layer protections are completely bypassed, and applications are targeted directly, instead of the underlying network stack, leaving them completely vulnerable.
This shift in the attack landscape calls for dedicated DDoS protection of assets deployed in the public cloud. In this blog, we will dive into the diverse array of DDoS protection options for the public cloud environments, the advantages, and drawbacks for each option, and who it is best suited for.
1.Native DDoS Protection by the Cloud Service Provider
Most cloud service providers (CSPs) offer some level of DDoS protection as part of their services. These solutions typically provide network-level protection and traffic scrubbing capabilities. Some cloud environments include this protection “built-in,” as part of their core technology stack. While they are a fundamental layer of defence, they may not be sufficient for mitigating large-scale or sophisticated attacks. However, CSPs also provide an advanced tier of DDoS protection services at an additional cost. These services offer more robust protection, including intelligent traffic analysis, anomaly detection, and the ability to absorb larger attacks.
Advantages and Drawbacks
Simple: CSPs’ DDoS protection services are integrated with their cloud environments, making it easier to set up and manage protection for your cloud-hosted resources. You can often enable and configure DDoS protection directly from your cloud provider’s dashboard.
Scalable: Public cloud providers can leverage their vast network infrastructure and resources to absorb and mitigate large-scale DDoS attacks. This scalability helps maintain service availability during an attack without affecting your cloud resources.
Protection Against Most Common Attacks: While the quality of protection might vary between different cloud providers the native DDoS protection by public cloud providers offers good coverage against most common attack vectors, particularly at the network layer.
Flexible: CSPs offer various protection tiers and configurations, allowing you to tailor your DDoS protection to your specific needs. You can adjust settings as your requirements change.
Free Basic DDoS Protection: Public cloud providers often provide DDoS protection as part of their standard services free of cost, reducing the need for organizations to invest in separate DDoS protection solutions. However, this can protect only against the most common attacks and the advanced tier is required for mitigating any type of sophisticated or application layer attacks.
Drawbacks of Cloud-Native DDoS Protection
Poor Protection Against Advanced Attack Vectors: Cloud providers are not specialized security vendors, and they often lack the expertise that comes from being at the forefront of the cybersecurity industry. While they provide adequate protection against common and frequently occurring attacks, they often lack protection against advanced attack vectors. This is especially true once attacks move into the application-layer, which requires different protections and often involves adding WAF protections.
No SLA Guarantees: Public cloud providers offer no commitments for their basic protection at all. However, if you purchase their advanced tier of DDoS protection, they provide “best effort” SLA commitments, but only for uptime. Moreover, when they do not meet their uptime commitment, they provide remediation in service credits which amounts to a mere fraction of the losses that may have been caused by a service disruption.
No Consistency across Clouds: Public cloud providers provide DDoS protection that is designed to protect their own infrastructure and not their customer’s applications hosted in their private data centre or another cloud infrastructure. Thus, customers with hybrid- and multi-cloud environments as they would then need to manage different solutions for each environment.
Limited Customization: CSP-provided DDoS protection services are typically designed to be easy to configure and use, which is an advantage for many users. However, this simplicity can mean limited customization options for organizations with specific or complex DDoS protection requirements.
Expensive Advanced Tiers: While basic DDoS protection offered by CSPs is free, more advanced, or comprehensive protection options come with additional costs. This becomes quite expensive because you will need to pay a monthly fee for each account or resource, and if you need more visibility into the traffic, you must turn on and pay for an additional service. All the additional charges add up quick and turn out to be quite expensive.
Best for: All in all, the native DDoS protection offered by cloud service providers offers basic protection which provides good coverage for most network-layer attacks. This will be good for those looking for cheap, no hassle, integrated protection with low latency. However, for organizations concerned about advanced protection, and organizations deploying applications across multiple clouds, typically they will need better security capabilities and cross-cloud consistency.

2.Public Cloud Virtual Appliance
A virtual appliance for DDoS protection is a software-based solution designed to defend against DDoS attacks by filtering and mitigating malicious traffic before it reaches your network or servers. These virtual appliances are deployed within the customers cloud environment as a virtual machine (VM) or container to monitor and mitigate DDoS attacks in real-time.
Advantages and Drawbacks
Flexible Deployment: Virtual appliances are highly flexible and can be deployed in various virtualized environments, including private data centers, public clouds, and hybrid environments. This flexibility makes them suitable for organizations with diverse infrastructures.
Control: Another key reason for selecting a virtual appliance-based DDoS protection is control. Many organizations and network managers put a high premium on control, and having your own virtual appliance in the cloud which allows for maximum control.
Advanced Capabilities: Some DDoS attacks like anti-scanning, brute force, password cracking, etc. require symmetric, two-way visibility into traffic which is possible only when a cloud based virtual appliance is deployed. It can also protect you from DDoS attacks from within the cloud.
Configurability: Virtual appliance solutions offer customizable policies and settings, allowing organizations to tailor their DDoS protection measures to specific needs and threat profiles.
Drawbacks
Resource Consumption Cost: Virtual appliances consume computing resources within your virtualized environment. During a DDoS attack, resource consumption can go up significantly, thereby not only increasing your cost but also potentially affecting the performance of other virtual machines or applications on the same infrastructure.
Limited Scalability: While virtual appliances are scalable, there is still a limit to the capacity of the underlying virtualized environment. Extremely large or sophisticated DDoS attacks may exceed the capacity of the virtual appliance license and can cause significant damage.
Management Overhead: Virtual appliances require regular maintenance, including software updates, patches, and policy adjustments. Organizations must allocate time and resources for ongoing management and upkeep.
Deployment Complexity: Deploying and configuring virtual appliances correctly can be complex, especially for organizations without extensive virtualization or cloud expertise.
Best for: Public-cloud virtual appliances are like pineapple on pizza, marmite, or the smell of patchouli: you either love or hate them. They are typically suited for deployments (and IT professionals) who are big on control and flexibility. They will typically be suitable for lift and shift deployment scenarios, applications requiring low latency, or complex architectures.
3.Third-party Cloud Solutions
Third-party DDoS mitigation services are specialized cloud-based solutions offered by independent cybersecurity providers that focus on protecting online services and resources of organizations against DDoS attacks. These services are designed to provide advanced and specialized tools and expertise in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks and minimize its impact.
Advantages and Drawbacks
Better Protection: Third-party DDoS mitigation ISVs are experts in DDoS attack detection and mitigation. They specialize in monitoring network traffic for signs of DDoS attacks and have in-depth knowledge of attack techniques and trends which makes their protection superior compared to that offered by the CSPs.
Consistency across All Environments: Customers with hybrid and multi-cloud environments will need to manage only one solution for DDoS Protection across their cloud and on-premises environment thereby increasing consistency in security and reducing managing overhead of having multiple solutions.
Continuous Monitoring and Expert Support: Many providers offer 24/7 monitoring and expert support, ensuring that skilled professionals are available around the clock to respond to threats.
Flexible Deployment Options: Most 3rd party solutions offer an always-on and on-demand deployment option to meet the diverse needs of their customers.
Better SLA: Most providers offer a better SLA with additional metrics for attack detection time, mitigation time, alerting, or quality of mitigation as compared to what the CSP offers but this commitment varies from vendor to vendor.
Drawbacks
Latency: This depends on the type of deployment option the customer chooses. With the on-demand service option, there is no latency during ‘peacetime’ when you are not under attack. Traffic is diverted only during times of attack, for the attack duration. However, in case of always-on, since all traffic is routed through the network of the DDoS mitigation provider, this will inevitably lead to additional latency to traffic.
Cost: Third-party services come with a cost, which can be a significant consideration, particularly for smaller organizations or organizations that do not have mission critical applications to protect on the cloud.
Best for: Third-party DDoS mitigation services are best for organizations looking for dedicated, advanced DDoS protection, particularly of missions-critical applications. It is also suitable for organizations which are frequently attacked, and need constant, high-grade protection.
In summary, DDoS protection is a fundamental component of cybersecurity in public cloud environments. It ensures the availability, performance, and security of cloud-hosted resources, helping organizations maintain their operations, protect their customers, and safeguard their reputation in an increasingly cloud-dependent world.
Securing your cloud environment against DDoS attacks is a multifaceted endeavour. While cloud service providers offer essential foundational protection, augmenting your defenses with advanced 3rd party cloud services can be vital.
There is no one size fits all here and organizations should carefully weigh the advantages and drawbacks of the different DDoS Protection options to determine whether these services align with their specific security needs. However, in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, it is essential to continuously assess your DDoS protection strategies and adapt them to emerging threats to keep your cloud environment resilient and secure.

Mastering On-Premises DDoS Defense: A Guide to Leveraging Analytics for Peak Performance

In the ever-changing landscape of digital connectivity, your network is far from static; it is a living, breathing entity. Each day brings new developments, as your network undergoes transformations in terms of size, services utilized, communication protocols, the myriad of clients tapping into those services, and the servers dutifully delivering them. But amidst this constant evolution, another dynamic force is at play – the emergence of new threats and attacks that lurk in the shadows, poised to disrupt your network’s harmony.
It’s imperative to ensure that your DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection system not only keeps pace with these changes but also provides you with crucial insights to shield your network from harm, while safeguarding the innocent users and clients who rely on your services.
To tackle this multifaceted challenge effectively, you need one key element: visibility into your network.
In this blog, we will delve into several key examples of network visibility, demonstrated with Radware’s new “Cyber Controller” Management console.
Query 1: Have you ever wondered which protected networks (policies) in your network are responsible for generating the highest peak traffic? This can be a critical piece of information for network administrators striving to optimize performance and security. Your busiest protected networks are in many cases the ones which are more sensitive and require special attention.
Finding the top contributors to peak traffic in your protected network, can be easily achieve by navigating to the dashboard that include the “Traffic Bandwidth” widget that presents the top-5 protected networks, their peak point time and the traffic along the request time period as presented below:

In the example above it is visible that policy named “P_1111” has the highest peak traffic at 17:45 and the max value is 692.49Mb. Now, using the widget options you can toggle between bps & pps for further analysis or change the time period to be analyzed.
Query 2: Are you aware of the dominant attack categories that have surfaced within your network over the past week? Furthermore, have you identified the protected networks where these attack categories are most frequently observed?
The widget below, along with its corresponding extension in the report, can furnish you with responses to the above question, occasionally revealing new trends that may have previously escaped your notice.

Further breakdown analysis is provided by same widget in a report with three levels of breakdown for further visibility and analysis per the various protected networks:

Query 3: Lately, I’ve been getting the sense that there’s been a notable uptick in the frequency of attacks, and I’m eager to validate it.

The widget above empowers users to examine and pinpoint fluctuations and spikes in attack numbers over time.
For instance, a notable increase in attacks was observed on September 11th. To delve deeper into this, you can zoom in and narrow the timeframe to that specific day, providing a clearer view. Furthermore, the widget referenced in the previously in query-2 (attack by Category) can be applied specifically to the September 11th period, allowing you to identify which attack categories experienced an uptick on that particular day.
By conducting this analysis, you can ascertain the necessary adjustments needed to refine the DDoS management protection configuration.
Query 4: I wish to analyze attacks of the same category and analyze the similarities and differences between these attacks. This can be helpful to determine if the attacks are coming from identical actors and assist in classifying the campaign and improve protection.
For analyzing this query, I need to have the specific attack details and not statistics. So, for this analysis, I will use a different tool “Forensics.” Forensics modules can extract to a CSV file different levels of attack information and then be further analyzed in excel.
In the example below, I wanted to analyze attacks from the last-month and refine my query so attack category “behavioral DOS” and only attacks greater than 1Mbps. Execution of this query will result in CSV file with all the attacks.

Query 5: Every now and then, I enjoy revisiting the behavior of my network to gain insights into the attacks that occur and how they are being handled by my DDoS protection system. I don’t have any particular concerns in mind; instead, I’m seeking a thorough analysis from diverse viewpoints, hoping it might assist me in recognizing any emerging trends.
To achieve the above, I can open the analytics main dashboard, that provides me with about 20 widgets, each one providing me with a different point of view.
For instance, in the screenshot provided below, I can observe five distinct perspectives examining my network. This multifaceted view could potentially offer valuable insights, detect trends, or even indicate an uptick in a particular type of cyberattack volume.

If the five graphs shown above haven’t yielded any insights, I can simply scroll down and examine an additional 10 graphs that offer further perspectives.
Summary
In the preceding inquiries, we explored a range of everyday situations where analytics tools can enhance your understanding and awareness of your network. Armed with this newfound visibility, you can make more informed adjustments to your DDoS Protection System, thereby bolstering the security of your network.

2023 Network and Application Threat Landscape
Over the last few years, the network and application threat landscape evolved and accelerated significantly. Organizations had to deal with several highly critical vulnerabilities, zero-day exploits, organized cybercrime groups, patriotic hacktivists and nation-states working in the shadows, hiding behind and between freedom fighters. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia brought with it a slew of patriotic crime groups on both sides of the war. Those groups democratized denial of service (DoS) attacks, making DoS accessible to a growing crowd of volunteers. After a year of causing nuisance and trouble across the globe, these new threat actors more became experienced, and their tactics and tools improved considerably. Hacktivism is not slowing down, quite the opposite, the threat from hacktivists is growing in both the number of groups as well as their targets. Their tactics have improved, automating their attacks to target more organizations, and hit where it hurts most by moving to more effective attack techniques. Alliances have come and gone, not every group sees eye to eye, but when objectives are aligned, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
2021 – the year of accelerated digitalization and increased attack surfaces
COVID-19 globally affected digital transformation. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and accelerated many businesses’ migration to the cloud while working from home became the new normal. As businesses migrated more applications to the public cloud, their attack surfaces expanded quite rapidly and significantly. The need to expose applications previously running within a secured perimeter and to allow access for a remote workforce increased the vulnerability of the organization against relentless initial access brokers looking to cash in a big paycheck from ransomware operators. Accelerating projects with the same means cannot be done without trade-offs. Soon a slew of new applications with known and unknown vulnerabilities, that were once contained within a secure perimeter, got exposed to the internet, a public service free and accessible for all.
2021 started in the shadow of the SolarWinds supply chain attack. By January, a ransomware assault led Colonial Pipeline’s executives to halt their oil distribution. As the year drew to a close, a vulnerability in the widely used log4j logging component rattled the digital realm. This flaw, prevalent in countless Java-based systems, became public knowledge in December 2021, causing a massive stir in the cybersecurity community. This security lapse enabled attackers, without authentication, to utilize easily accessible exploits for remote command execution (RCE). Many experts branded it not just as the most critical flaw of the year but possibly the worst of the decade.
In October 2021, UK VoIP providers faced multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assaults. Bandwidth.com later reported a significant financial hit due to these attacks, with losses of $700,000 in their Q3 revenue. The company projected a staggering $12 million in combined real and reputational damages. 2021 marked a year when Ransom DoS made a dominant appearance in the DDoS threat scene.
The year also witnessed significant crackdowns on organized crime. In Europe, unprecedented arrests in drug trafficking took place, largely credited to prior actions by European police who infiltrated encrypted devices used widely by criminals. In the cyber domain, collaborative actions between Eastern and Western entities delivered a tough hit to ransomware activities. This partnership created a challenging environment for ransomware operators and their affiliates. Notably, Russian crime groups, primarily targeting organizations outside Russian territories, faced a bleak future when Russian officials apprehended members of the REvil group within their borders.
2022 – the start of an invasion
Amidst extended lockdowns, the information technology industry was confronted with an evolved reality. The prevalence and vast resources behind cybercrime reached alarming levels. The intricacies of hybrid architectures made defense more challenging, creating expansive threat landscapes.
Compounding these issues, there was a shortage of skilled security professionals who could pick up the pieces and close the gaps quickly. Cybercrime was the new pandemic, and it was growing year after year.
On February 24, 2022, the world was shaken with the news of Russia’s special military operation against Ukraine. This date, which marked the start of the war, will be engraved in our memories for a long time. Preceding the army movements, cyber operations attributed to the state actors of the Russian nation were already, for some time, waging against Ukraine.
What unfolded were multifaceted cyber battlefronts, where the digital warfare spanned various layers and was not just confined to the countries in direct conflict. New cyber legions emerged; , some rooted in government initiatives, others grown out of moral patriotism. Both cybercrime factions redefined their arsenals, reset their goals, and deployed aggressive cyber strategies with intentions to destabilize governments, sow discord, and control narratives.
The lines of the battlefields were often blurred. Patriotic hacktivist operations served as convenient fronts for the warring nations. Identifying the actual perpetrators became challenging, and any assertions came with the risk of eliciting counterattacks, potentially escalating conflicts. It remains ambiguous which groups operate autonomously for a common goal, and which are mere puppets in a strategic game of thrones.
While the Russia-Ukraine conflict dominated headlines, other cyber adversaries did not suspend their activities. As the world’s focus remained on Russia, numerous cyber entities operated stealthily. In June 2022, a joint advisory from the CISA, NSA, and FBI (AA22-158A) highlighted that state-backed actors from the People’s Republic of China persistently exploited known vulnerabilities. Their objective was to establish a vast network of compromised infrastructure spanning both public and private sector organizations. The advisory accentuated how these actors infiltrated major telecom and network service providers.
The ethos for the year seemed to be “DDoS is not a crime.” Vigilantes on both sides of the Russo-Ukrainian war leveraged whatever knowledge and resources they had to support their nation through hacking campaigns, convinced of the fact that their actions were morally acceptable and legal. 2022, without a doubt, became the year where network-level DDoS reached new heights, both in terms of volume and size.
2023 – Denial of Service Attacks Moving Up the Stack
The cybersecurity landscape continued to rapidly evolve in the first half of 2023, with a significant shift in Denial-of-Service attack patterns. There is a growing trend where DoS attacks are ascending to layer 7, targeting not just the online applications and their APIs but also essential infrastructure such as the Domain Name System (DNS). In the first half of this year, there was a considerable growth in DNS query floods while Web Distributed Denial-of-Service (Web DDoS) attacks have become more sophisticated, utilizing high Request Per Second (RPS) traffic combined with randomization of multiple elements of the request to create seemingly legitimate traffic. Such techniques have been adopted by multiple hacktivist collectives, including the likes of Anonymous Sudan and NoName057(16).

Figure 1: 2023 Major Attack Trends (*)
Hacktivists constitute a major part of the L7 DDoS problem. The effectiveness of these attacks has been significantly amplified by nationalistic volunteers participating in crowdsourced botnets or by equipping volunteers with custom attack tools and comprehensive tutorials on carrying out such attacks.
Though HTTPS Floods have existed for some time and might be perceived as old news, their scale and force have surged remarkably in recent times. Concurrently, the craftiness and aggressiveness of the culprits have been on an upward trajectory.

Figure 2: 2023 Tactics and Techniques
A noticeable trend is the transition of malicious actors to cloud-based operations. Instead of relying on compromised IoT devices, they are now leveraging the scalability and cost-effectiveness of cloud services with high-speed internet connections. This allows them to orchestrate a limited number of powerful nodes instead of compromising and maintaining large networks of devices without getting noticed. The advantages are considerable: they maintain control over their servers, suffer no loss from device reboots, and run a lower risk of detection by security researchers. By utilizing bulletproof hosting and proxy services that provide frequently rotating residential IP addresses, they have established the perfect platform to launch high-frequency, sophisticated Web DDoS attacks.
Concluding
Cybercriminals have redirected their attacks in 2023, targeting online applications and their surrounding infrastructure. While overall global DDoS activity held steady compared to 2022, attention has shifted from network DDoS attacks to more sophisticated, application-level Web DDoS attacks. Organizations must adapt as attackers turn to the cloud for additional scale, agility, and control.

Unravelling the DNS DDoS Threat Landscape

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the backbone of the internet, translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. This pivotal system enables users to access applications across the web. Without DNS, the internet as we know it today would be impossible to use. However, as the internet evolves and plays an increasingly central role in our lives, the complexity and frequency of DNS DDoS threats have been on the rise. DNS attacks can have far-reaching consequences, affecting critical infrastructure, services, and the economy on a global scale. Imagine being unable to access your favourite websites and applications – it is not just annoying; it is a business nightmare.
In this blog post, we will delve into the challenges posed by the modern DNS DDoS threat landscape and the popular DNS DDoS attack vectors.
Shifting Tides: A Changing Attack Landscape
There has been a significant shift that has been witnessed in DDoS attack trends, transitioning from targeting lower-level network layers (L3/L4) to becoming more sophisticated and moving on to the Application layer. This shift has catalysed the exponential growth of DNS DDoS attacks. DNS, due to its pivotal role in internet traffic routing, has become a popular target for these assaults. When a DNS server falls victim to a DoS attack, users cannot access the websites, services or APIs associated with that server because their browsers and applications cannot resolve the IP addresses corresponding to those domain names. As a result, the legitimate user experience is significantly degraded or entirely disrupted.
The Alarming Rise in Threats: Data and Figures
Numbers can be boring, but these are a bit scary. According to Radware’s H1 2023 Threat Landscape report, the frequency of DNS Flood attacks in the first month of Q2 2023 was quadruple that of the same month in Q2 2022. We also recorded the most significant DNS Flood over the past two years, with a peak attack rate reaching 1.29 million DNS queries per second in April 2023.

Figure 1: DNS Flood attack vector ratio evolution over time
Top 5 DNS DDoS Threats to Watch Out For
As a global cybersecurity provider, Radware tracks attack trends across its cloud security network. These are the top DNS DDoS threats we currently see:
DNS NXDOMAIN Attack
In this type of DNS attack, the attacker floods DNS servers with requests for non-existent domains, resulting in DNS recursion and NXDOMAIN responses. This causes the server to process numerous requests for domain names that do not exist, thus consuming the server’s resources instead of processing legitimate requests and leading to a denial-of-service situation.
DNS Flood Attack
Attackers utilize a network of compromised computers called botnets to send a massive volume of DNS requests to the target DNS server, which floods the DNS server and causes it to become unresponsive. This behavior allows the attacker to successfully compromise the DNS service utilizing a surprisingly small number of botnets.
DNS Water Torture
DNS water torture also known as DNS Random Sub-domain attack is a slow and steady DDoS attack in which the attacker sends a constant stream of small, legitimate-looking DNS queries to the victim’s DNS server at a slow rate. Each individual query by itself might not cause significant harm, but the continuous flow of queries gradually overwhelms the DNS server’s resources and causes performance degradation or complete unresponsiveness over time.
Phantom Domain Attack
This attack involves the attacker setting up one or more phantom domains that do not respond to DNS queries and sending requests to the victim’s DNS server to resolve the phantom domains. The victim’s DNS server gets overwhelmed when it tries to resolve the phantom domains through non-responsive servers. This causes the recursive server to spend valuable resources waiting for responses that will never come.
DNS Amplification Attack
This happens when attackers exploit the misconfigured DNS servers such that the DNS response is much larger than the DNS request. The attacker sends a large number of small DNS queries with a spoofed source IP address to the targeted DNS server. The server then sends the amplified responses to the victim’s IP address, overwhelming its network capacity. With this attack technique, a relatively small botnet can carry out a volumetric flood of large responses toward the victim, thus saturating its Internet pipe.
According to Radware’s H1 2023 Threat Landscape report, DNS amplification was the amplification attack vector that generated the most volume in H1 2023, representing 61.6% of the total amplification volume, with an amplification factor of 160x.
In each case, the attacker’s objective is to disrupt the DNS service and make the websites and online services that rely on it inaccessible. These attacks exploit different aspects of the DNS protocol, making them challenging to defend against and highlighting the importance of implementing robust DNS security measures.
The Devastating Impact of a DNS DDoS Attack
Imagine a sudden blackout in the heart of a bustling city. Streetlights flicker, traffic halts, and chaos ensues. In the digital realm, a DNS Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is the equivalent of that blackout – a swift and crippling disruption that can bring an organization’s online presence to its knees. The aftermath of a DNS DDoS attack paints a grim picture:
Digital Isolation
A DNS DDoS attack can cut off an organization from its customers, partners, and the entire online world. Websites become inaccessible, apps stop working, and emails go undelivered. It’s like a store with locked doors during peak shopping hours.
Damaged Reputation
Trust takes years to build and seconds to crumble. An attack can tarnish an organization’s reputation, eroding the trust customers have in the brand which can negatively impact the business and potentially push them towards competitors.
Operational Challenges
Internal operations can grind to a halt. Employees rely on digital tools for communication, collaboration, and productivity. An attack disrupts these processes, leaving teams stranded and businesses struggling to function.
Financial Hemorrhage
Every moment of downtime translates to potential revenue loss. The longer the attack persists, the deeper the financial wound, affecting bottom lines and growth prospects.
Summary
In a world where digital continuity is paramount, a DNS DDoS attack isn’t just a technical hiccup; it’s a multi-dimensional crisis and the imperative to protect DNS infrastructure cannot be overstated. Not securing the DNS infrastructure properly is like leaving an open window for cyber criminals—offering them free access to your network, your resources and risking your online business availability.
Organizations must fortify their defenses against the rising tide of DNS DDoS attacks, ensuring a secure and seamless online experience for their users. Radware provides the industry a complete solution for protecting DNS critical infrastructure against today’s most advanced DNS DDoS attacks. Radware uses advanced behavioral-based detection and automatic real-time signatures to identify the DNS attacks and automatically stop it so that organizations can effectively safeguard their critical infrastructure, ensure uninterrupted service availability, and protect customer trust.

5 Ways DDoS Attacks Disrupt Healthcare Services
Healthcare institutions are experiencing a significant digital transformation, with a growing reliance on technology to deliver critical services and patient care. With the increasing adoption of electronic health records, telemedicine, and online patient portals, the availability and seamless operation of healthcare applications and services has become paramount. This is why protecting against DDoS attacks is critical for hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other healthcare institutions.
The evolving threat landscape of DDoS attacks in the healthcare sector
Healthcare institutions are required to provide uninterrupted access to medical information and services, ensuring timely and efficient patient care. Any disruption to these essential systems due to DDoS attacks can have severe consequences, jeopardizing patient safety, compromising data integrity, and affecting the reputation of the institution.
Moreover, the evolving threat landscape of DDoS attacks adds to the concerns of healthcare institutions. Cybercriminals are continuously adapting their tactics, leveraging sophisticated attack vectors to exploit vulnerabilities. The convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare, such as connected medical devices and wearable technology, introduces additional attack surfaces, making the healthcare industry more susceptible to DDoS attacks.
As healthcare institutions strive to deliver high-quality patient care while ensuring data security and compliance, investing in a comprehensive DDoS protection solution becomes imperative. A robust DDoS protection strategy can safeguard critical systems, prevent service disruptions, and maintain the trust of patients and partners. By proactively defending against and mitigating DDoS attacks, healthcare institutions can focus on their primary mission of providing exceptional patient care while preserving the integrity of sensitive medical information.
DDoS Attacks Campaigns Against Healthcare Institutions
One of the biggest shifts in the DDoS threat landscape in recent times is the rise of state-sponsored and ”hacktivist” groups and the emergence of political motivation—rather than financial motivation–as the main driver for DDoS attacks. As a result, the profile of targeted victims has expanded to include governmental institutions, civilian infrastructure, and non-profit organizations. Sadly, this has also led to an increase in DDoS attacks against hospitals and healthcare institutions.
One such high-profile attack was the campaign in late 2022 by the pro-Russian hacktivist group, Killnet. The attack targeted hospitals and medical centers inside the U.S. and other pro-Ukraine nations. Websites of more than 14 medical centers across the U.S. were hit by DDoS attacks, including high-profile institutions such as Stanford Healthcare, Duke University Hospital and Cedars-Sinai. Another example was the campaign by Anonymous Sudan against hospitals and healthcare institutions in Denmark and Sweden in February 2023. These attacks were motivated by the actions of local politicians that the group found objectionable.

Yet another example targeted hospitals and government institutions in India in March and April 2023. Launched by pro-Russian groups and Islamist hacktivist groups such as Anonymous Sudan, the attacks brought down the websites of several hospitals in the Hyderabad area, as well as the Indian Ministry of Health. These attacks appeared to be motivated by both politics and religion.

link to the article
As these examples show, hospitals and healthcare organizations are increasingly targeted by state-sponsored and hacktivist groups for reasons completely unrelated to the actions of the organizations themselves, but rather because of geo-political events, local disputes, and religious tensions. Nonetheless, they demonstrate that healthcare organizations are at the forefront of DDoS attack activity and must act to protect themselves accordingly.
How DDoS Attacks Harm Healthcare Institutions
In the ever-evolving healthcare landscape, institutions face many challenges and concerns, particularly when protecting their critical digital infrastructure from the perils of DDoS attacks. The seamless operation of healthcare applications and services has become mission-critical, as patient care increasingly relies on technology and data accessibility. However, the rise of DDoS attacks poses a grave threat to healthcare institutions, causing disruptions, compromising patient safety, breaching data security, inflicting financial losses, damaging reputations, and leading to compliance violations. In this context, a robust DDoS protection strategy becomes essential for healthcare institutions to ensure uninterrupted patient care, safeguard sensitive information, and uphold their reputation and trust within the industry.
DDoS attacks can cause significant harm to healthcare institutions in various ways:
Financial Losses: DDoS attacks can result in significant financial losses for healthcare institutions. The costs associated with mitigating the attack, restoring services, and implementing additional security measures can be substantial. Moreover, the loss of revenue due to service disruptions and potential patient churn can further impact the institution’s bottom line.
Disruption of Critical Patient Services: DDoS attacks can overwhelm the network infrastructure and targeted servers, leading to service disruptions. Healthcare institutions heavily rely on electronic health record systems, patient portals, and communication platforms for critical functions like patient care, appointment scheduling, and medical record access. Any disruption to these services can hinder healthcare professionals’ ability to provide timely and effective care to patients.
Risk to Patient Safety: In healthcare, timely access to medical information and services is crucial for patient safety. DDoS attacks that disrupt access to patient records or medical devices can delay vital treatments and procedures, potentially endangering patients’ lives.
Cover Up of Data Breach Attempts: Some DDoS attacks serve as a smokescreen to divert attention while hackers attempt to breach the institution’s security and access sensitive patient data. Such attacks can lead to data breaches and expose private patient information, resulting in legal and regulatory consequences, financial penalties, and damage to the institution’s reputation.
Brand Reputation Damage: A successful DDoS attack on a healthcare institution can erode the trust and confidence of patients and partners. The negative publicity and perception of compromised data security may lead to patients seeking care from competitors, impacting the institution’s reputation and market standing.
Overall, DDoS attacks pose a severe threat to healthcare institutions, not only in terms of immediate service disruptions but also in long-term consequences related to patient safety, data security, financial stability, and reputation.

Summary
In an era of transformative technological integration within healthcare, the vulnerability of healthcare institutions to DDoS attacks cannot be underestimated. As digitalization accelerates, reliance on technology for patient care and critical services grows, demanding uninterrupted access to healthcare applications. This vulnerability has been further compounded by the evolving landscape of DDoS attacks, which now encompass politically motivated and state-sponsored campaigns. This shift has targeted hospitals and medical centers, causing disruptions that compromise patient safety, data integrity, financial stability, and institutional reputation.
To safeguard patient care, sensitive information, and industry trust, healthcare institutions must adopt robust DDoS protection strategies that shield against these multifaceted threats.

A Look Inside the Attacker’s Toolkit: DNS DDoS Attacks
DNS is a critical infrastructure for your online services, a DNS DDoS attack risks the availability of your services. Attackers are experts in DNS and know all the weak points to target. Understanding how a DNS DDoS looks like, and the risks it poses to your business is key to designing a robust DNS security posture.
DNS is the cornerstone of the Internet
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the internet infrastructure. DNS is responsible for resolving hostnames into IP addresses. If DNS fails, online applications, services and third-party web APIs that many applications depend on, will become unavailable. DNS service is increasingly becoming a prime target for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
DNS DDoS attacks can cause significant disruptions to internet services, resulting in service unavailability, slow response times, and even complete network outages. These attacks can also lead to significant financial losses and damage to a company’s reputation.
As attackers become more sophisticated, the risks associated with DNS DDoS attacks continue to grow. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the scale and frequency of DNS DDoS attacks, and attackers are constantly innovating new techniques to evade detection and cause maximum damage.
Radware’s 2022 global threat analysis reports found that the Domain Name System (DNS) represented 26.4% of the targeted applications. DNS amplification was the amplification attack vector that generated the most attack volume in 2022, representing 77.1% of the total amplification volume.

In the past several months, we have witnessed a significant rise in DNS Flood attacks. We have encountered multiple DNS attacks affecting various organizations. In April 2023, we recorded the most significant DNS Flood over the past two years, with a peak attack rate reaching 1.29 million DNS queries per second [1].
DNS Security Is Still Weak
While DNS plays a vital role on the internet, it remains alarmingly weak, vulnerable to various threats. Among these threats, DDoS attacks targeting DNS infrastructure have emerged as a significant concern. Here are the main reasons for this:
Complex and Decentralized Infrastructure
The distributed architecture of DNS, designed for redundancy and efficient resolution, inadvertently creates a multitude of potential targets for attackers. Each DNS resolver and authoritative server represents a potential weak link that can be exploited in a DDoS attack.
Insufficient Network Capacity
DNS infrastructure is built to handle a massive volume of queries daily. However, the increasing scale and frequency of DDoS attacks have revealed the vulnerability of DNS to overwhelming traffic. Attackers leverage botnets and amplification techniques to flood DNS servers with an unprecedented number of requests, overwhelming their processing capacity. As a result, legitimate users are unable to access the desired websites or services, leading to widespread disruptions.
Limited Authentication and Validation
Traditionally, DNS lacked robust authentication and validation mechanisms, making it susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS. The absence of strong measures to verify the authenticity of DNS responses enables attackers to manipulate DNS records, redirect legitimate traffic, or launch amplification attacks. While efforts like DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) have been introduced to enhance the integrity of DNS data, its adoption remains limited, leaving a significant portion of the DNS ecosystem vulnerable to exploitation.
Incomplete Adoption of Best Practices
Despite the availability of best practices and security guidelines, the implementation of these measures across the DNS landscape remains inconsistent. Organizations responsible for managing DNS infrastructure, including ISPs, domain registrars, and administrators, often fail to prioritize security measures or lack the necessary expertise. This negligence leads to the persistence of outdated software, misconfigurations, and weak defenses, which attackers readily exploit.
DNS DDoS attack: behind the scenes
Attackers take advantage of the weak points in DNS to launch attacks using various techniques. With DNS mostly over UDP, attackers can easily hide the original source IP by spoofing, leverage botnets to achieve scale, reflect the attack queries from open resolvers or ISP resolvers, and use amplification techniques to flood the DNS servers.
Now, let’s take a closer look inside the attacker’s toolkit to learn about the main steps for launching a DNS DDoS attack:
Step 1: Planning
An attack, as any project, starts with planning. The attacker first chooses his target DNS name servers. He needs to map the root domains he wants to attack. For that purpose, he can send legitimate requests in low volume to map the domain and some subdomains.
Step 2: DDoS Attack Tool
The attacker can develop a new DDoS attack tool from scratch; however, this is more complicated and can take too long. Nowadays, the attacker’s life is made easy with the prosperity of ready “off-the-shelf” DDoS attack tools available on the Darknet. Mirai was one of the famous IOT botnet with a DNS attack vector that made a major impact on a well-known DNS provider back in 2016. From than to now, numerous Mirai variants were created and many IOT botnets too. Most of these DNS DDoS tools have one main vector in common – the random subdomain flood nicked by Mirai as the DNS water torture. This attack vector is highly popular among attackers and can cause significant slowdown or even outage to unprotected DNS servers.

Mirai variants, offered as packages by scale
In DNS water torture the attacker sends many DNS queries with random prefixes (or subdomains) of the target domain, to make sure they reach the target authoritative server. Using a random prefix, the attacker ensures that the cache DNS forwards the query to the authoritative name server.
If we consider mydomain.com as the target domain, then the attack queries can look like – rThnBzl.mydomain.com, tngkoK8nbdms.mydomain.com, or human-readable prefixes that do not exist on authoritative name server. [2]

Graphical example for DNS water torture attack
Step 3: Scale
To make an impact, the attacker needs scale. So, his next step would be to take over a botnet or rent one. Nowadays, attackers, with the proper funding, can hire or purchase botnets in the darknet and achieve scale easily.
Thanks to the prosperity of IOT devices, botnets are made available on the darknet and keep growing daily. The IOT devices have real source IP and are easy to take over due to basic security and default passwords. In addition, IOT devices support various protocols allowing attackers to launch advanced attack vectors including DNS.
We witness DNS attacks originating from real source IPs, meaning attackers are most likely using IOT botnets, without the need for IP spoofing. IP spoofing can be dropped by ISPs, so by using real IP botnets attackers can bypass this security control at ISP level and successfully launch the DNS attack.
Step 4: Anonymization
Attackers typically hide their identity using anonymizers and TOR, for communicating and operating their botnet. Once the attack is launched, traffic originates from the botnet, without any link to the original identity of the attacker. The attacker can use IP spoofing to communicate with the botnet or query the target DNS server directly. Another option is to leverage the DNS hierarchy to hide the origin of attack queries. The botnet sends the attack queries through open DNS resolvers that forward them to the target authoritative server. Every query appears legitimate, coming from a legitimate DNS resolver and the challenge is to distinguish between good and bad queries to protect the DNS service.
Step 5: Launch!
Once the attacker controls a botnet, and has the DNS vector ready to run, the last part is to hit START and issue a command to the botnet. This step will be triggered according to the attacker’s agenda – it can be hacktivism, financial, or political. With DDoS, attackers often combine ransom threat along with the DDoS attack.
How To Protect Your DNS Infrastructure
Now that you have a better understanding of how a DNS DDoS attack looks like, you can optimize our DNS protection. Here are important guidelines:
Perimeter DNS protection: A strong DNS server is important but insufficient to protect from DNS DDoS due to its network location. A DNS DDoS can risk your entire infrastructure prior to reaching the DNS server.
Complete Protection: Attackers can use one DNS vector or multiple, you should prefer a security solution that is comprehensive, covering various types of DNS vectors, including zero-day DNS water torture attacks.
Adaptive Mitigation: Attackers can use spoofing, real IP botnets, or open DNS resolvers. You need to make sure your protection is adaptive and agnostic to attack sources.
Zero impact on legitimate traffic: Attackers try to craft queries that appear legitimate. You should prefer a security solution that can automatically and accurately distinguish between attack and legitimate queries under attack to avoid impact to legitimate traffic.
Early Protection: DNS DDoS can cause degradation to the DNS service and even outage. You should prefer solutions that protect the DNS service without the need to inspect the DNS server’s responses. Waiting for the server’s responses for security might be too late, putting at risk the DNS service availability and operation.

Escalating Trends in DNS Flood Attacks
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental pillar of our digital economy. Denial-of-service attacks targeting DNS can severely impact businesses and cause damage to revenue, customer trust, and business reputation. Our latest analysis indicates a growing trend in the ratio of DNS Flood attacks over the last three quarters. Notably, the frequency of these attacks in the first month of Q2 2023 was four times higher than the corresponding month in Q2 2022. This escalating situation peaked in April when we observed the largest DNS Flood attack in the past two years, registering a rate of 1.29 million DNS queries per second.
Despite the increasing frequency and complexity, it is important to note that DNS Floods are application-level attacks, designed to overwhelm the server without necessarily saturating the internet connection. Our analysis confirms that in the last two years, all observed DNS Floods maintained a traffic rate considerably below 1Gbps, underlining their strategic focus on disrupting service rather than consuming bandwidth.
As such, these findings indicate the urgent need for heightened vigilance and fortification of DNS defenses to counteract this escalating threat landscape.
Insights
There has been a significant escalation in the proportion of DNS Flood attacks in the recent three quarters.
The frequency of DNS Flood attacks in the first month of Q2 2023 was quadruple that of the same month in Q2 2022.
In April 2023, we recorded the most significant DNS Flood over the past two years, with a peak attack rate reaching 1.29 million DNS queries per second.
In 2023, two-thirds of the observed DNS Floods targeted DNS type A records.
The second most leveraged query type was the DNS AAAA record query, which contributed to 8% of the attacks, followed by the DNS MX record query, which made up 4%.
One in every six DNS Floods in 2023 incorporated a mix of different query types within a single attack.
DNS Floods are application-layer attacks, with the primary goal of overloading the server rather than saturating the internet connection. Over the past two years, all DNS Floods have kept their traffic rate significantly below 1Gbps.
No DNS, No Business
The digital era has catalyzed rapid growth in online commercial activities, making e-commerce and online platforms a vital component of the global economy. However, this technological advancement is not without its vulnerabilities. A crucial and ubiquitous part of this digital ecosystem is the DNS, which acts as the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses. When a DNS service is subjected to a cyberattack, such as denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), the disruption caused can be catastrophic for businesses.
Denial-of-service attacks are malicious attempts to overwhelm a network, service, or server with excessive traffic or requests, causing them to slow down significantly or, worse, crash. The fundamental aim of these attacks is to disrupt the targeted system's regular functioning, denying legitimate users access to the services or information they seek.
DNS is a particularly popular target for these attacks because of its vital role in internet traffic routing. When a DNS server falls victim to a DoS attack, users cannot access the websites, services or APIs associated with that server because their browsers and applications can't resolve the IP addresses corresponding to those domain names. As a result, the user experience is significantly degraded or entirely disrupted, resulting in lost revenue, damaged reputation, and a decline in customer trust.
The impact of a DNS-based DoS attack can be colossal, particularly for e-commerce businesses. It's not simply a matter of lost sales during the outage period. Consider that in 2022, Amazon AWS (cloud) generated over $80 billion in revenue, an average of over $152,000 per minute. The potential loss from even a brief outage is staggering. Furthermore, these disruptions damage the business's reputation, undermine consumer confidence and lead to potential long-term loss of customers. Additionally, businesses may face legal ramifications if unable to meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs) due to such disruptions.
DIFFERENT TYPES OF DNS DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS
DNS denial-of-service attacks can come in various forms, each with unique techniques and impacts. Here are the most common attack types:
DNS Amplification Attack: This is a type of network-level, reflection-based, volumetric DDoS attack where the attacker crafts a DNS query packet with a forged source IP address (the victim's). It sends it to a legitimate, open, DNS resolver, which subsequently replies to the victim with a large amount of data. The goal is to overwhelm the victim's network with traffic.
Phantom Domain Attack: This attack involves the attacker setting up one or more phantom domains that do not respond to DNS queries and sending requests to the victim's DNS server to resolve the phantom domains. The victim's DNS server gets overwhelmed when it tries to resolve the phantom domains through non-responsive servers. This causes the recursive server to spend valuable resources waiting for responses that will never come.
DNS Flood Attack: A DNS Flood is a type of application-layer DDoS attack that seeks to overload a DNS server with a high volume of requests until it becomes unresponsive. The requests appear legitimate, making it difficult to filter out malicious traffic.
DNS NXDOMAIN Attack: In this type of DNS Flood attack the attacker sends a high volume of requests for non-existent or invalid domains, resulting in DNS recursion and NXDOMAIN (nonexistent domain) responses. The server must work hard to try and resolve these spurious requests, thus consuming valuable resources instead of processing legitimate requests. When a DNS server is under NXDOMAIN attack, the cache of the DNS server will be flooded with NXDOMAIN results, forcing the server to resolve legitimate requests repeatedly instead of fetching the answer from its cache.
Pseudo Random Subdomain (PRSD) Attack: Also known as water torture attacks, this attack is similar to the DNS NXDOMAIN attack. The attacker sends a massive number of requests for non-existent subdomains of a valid and existing domain through different recursive resolvers. This causes the authoritative server to consume resources trying to resolve these nonexistent subdomains, eventually leading to a denial of service.
In each case, the attacker's objective is to disrupt the DNS service and make the websites and online services that rely on it inaccessible. These attacks exploit different aspects of the DNS protocol, making them challenging to defend against and highlighting the importance of implementing robust DNS security measures.
DNS Flood Trends
A quantitative analysis of the most common types of DNS Floods detected and mitigated by our Cloud DDoS Protection Service points to an increasing trend in the occurrence and intensity of such DDoS attacks.
GROWING TREND
DDoS attacks consist of one or more attack vectors. By determining the proportion of attacks utilizing a DNS Flood attack vector in relation to the overall count of attacks, we can gauge the progression of DNS Floods over time, irrespective of the total activity or the number of customers protected by our services.
Figure 1: DNS Flood Attack Ratio Evolution over Time
Throughout 2021 and the first half of 2022, fewer than 32 out of every 1,000 attacks incorporated a DNS Flood vector. However, from Q3 of 2022, we noted a marked increase in the proportion of attacks featuring a DNS Flood vector. The ratio experienced a twofold surge from Q3 to Q4 of last year, rising to 84 attacks per 1,000 in April of 2023 with each involving a DNS Flood component. This dramatic increase first emerged in Q4 of last year, and by the initial month of Q2 2023, it had quadrupled compared to the same period in 2022.
The area chart depicted in Figure 2 traces the development of the count of DNS Flood attacks according to each query type. A description of the key DNS record types can be found in Table 1 at the end of this document. The total number of DNS Floods mitigated each month corroborates the escalating trend discerned in the previous DNS Flood attack ratio. From September 2022 onwards, the monthly volume of DNS Floods has consistently surpassed the figures recorded in the preceding months.
Figure 2: Number of DNS Floods per Month
FLOODS HITTING HARDER
DNS Floods are application-layer assaults with the objective of compromising the server's capability to manage valid DNS requests. The pace of these requests determines the total effect on the server. The blue trajectory in Figure 3's chart illustrates the highest DNS query rate detected each quarter, denoted in queries per second (QPS). Aside from a notable DNS Flood attack in Q1 of 2021, which peaked at 1.59 million QPS, the DNS Floods since Q4 of last year have been significantly larger in scale compared to prior quarters. The largest DNS Flood in the past two years was observed in April 2023, registering an attack rate of 1.29 million DNS queries per second.
The red trajectory in Figure 3's chart demonstrates the peak traffic of the most significant DNS Flood each quarter. The traffic rate shows a consistent pattern aligning with the maximum query rate. It is important to understand that application-level attacks focus on overloading the server, which does not necessarily equate to a traffic volume high enough to saturate the server's internet connection. The red line effectively emphasizes this point, considering that the most substantial DNS Flood recorded a traffic volume of less than 1.3Gbps, and all DNS Floods monitored over the past two years remained notably under the 1Gbps threshold.
Figure 3: Queries per Second and Bandwidth Consumption by DNS Floods
DNS FLOOD TYPES
The most prevalent DNS query leveraged in DNS Floods in 2023 was the regular hostname to IPv4 query, accounting for almost 65% of the attacks. The second most used query was the hostname to IPv6 query, deployed in close to 8% of all DNS Floods in 2023. Over 15% of the DNS Floods consisted of a mixture of various types of queries, termed as DNS-ALL Flood in the chart in Figure 4. MX queries took the third spot in terms of their usage in DNS Floods.
Figure 4: DNS Flood Type Distribution in 2023
Conclusion
A
The address mapping record, also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.
AAAA
The IP Version 6 address record stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.
CNAME
The canonical name record is used to alias a hostname to another hostname. When a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname, the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new hostname.
MX
The mail exchanger record specifies an SMTP email server for the domain.
NS
The name server record specifies that a DNS Zone, such as “example.com,” is delegated to a specific authoritative name server and provides the address of that name server.
PTR
The reverse-lookup pointer record provides the IP address of a hostname (reverse DNS lookup).
SRV
The service location record is like the MX record, but for other services.
TXT
The text record can contain arbitrary information and typically carries machine-readable data such as opportunistic encryption, sender policy framework (SPF), DKIM, DMARC, etc.
SOA
The Start of Authority record appears at the beginning of a DNS zone file and indicates the authoritative name server for the current DNS zone, contact details of the domain administrator, domain file version number, and information on how frequently DNS information for this zone should be refreshed.
NAPTR
The Naming Authority Pointer records map domain names to URIs (uniform resource identifiers) and other resources. NAPTR records are commonly used for applications in internet telephony.

What is DNS Flood Attack (DNS Flooding)
What is DNS Flood Attack (DNS Flooding)?
Domain Name System (DNS) are the directories used to resolve between machine-readable addresses of websites (such as 191.168.0.1:80) and human-readable names (e.g. radware.com)
A DNS flood is a type of DDoS (distributed denial-of-service attack) when an attacker floods a particular domain’s DNS servers to disrupt resolution for that domain.
How does a DNS flood attack work?
Sending a massive number of DNS requests to a DNS server can consume its resources, resulting in a significantly slower response time for legitimate DNS requests.
By slowing down or disrupting DNS resolution, a DNS Flood attack will disable or degrade the performance of a website, API or web application's ability respond to legitimate traffic.
How can a DNS Flood attack be mitigated?
Since DNS name resolution is used in normal internet communication, during heavy loads, DNS Flood attacks can be difficult to distinguish from normal heavy traffic especially if the floods have many unique sources.
Attackers exploit the DNS’ hierarchical infrastructure weaknesses and protocol vulnerabilities for mounting attacks against DNS services, targeting either recursive resolvers or authoritative servers. Many such attacks such as DNS amplification, DNS spoofing, Reflection, NXDomain and NXNSDomain are now common.
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were introduced in 2005 to preclude spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.
DNS over HTTPS or DoH was introduced to increase the privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data through man-in-the-middle attacks.
Although DNSSEC and DoH can help with authentication, privacy and integrity; however, they cannot protect from query floods, NXDomain and NXNSDomain attacks.
Securing the perimeter is key to protecting DNS infrastructure. You’ll need a security solution that can detect and mitigate an attack based on ingress requests only and prevent the bad queries from entering your DNS infrastructure to begin with. Not relying on a bi-directional response detection can also minimize impacts from bogus domain requests.
Since high-volume floods can consume resources of stateful devices you need a stateless DNS security solution.
Accurate attack filtering with minimal risk of false positives requires achieving a high detection accuracy between a good and a bad DNS request. Behavioral algorithms can detect statistical anomalies in DNS traffic and generate an accurate attack footprint based on a heuristic protocol information analysis to prevent and protect from DNS Flood attacks.
How Radware mitigates DNS Flood Attacks
Radware DDoS protection solutions mitigate DNS Flood attacks via behavioral-based protection. Protection is provided across all three phases of an attack: detection, characterization and mitigation.
During the detection phase, Radware monitors all inbound DNS traffic and learns the baseline of normal DNS traffic behavior using various logics and monitoring various baselines and parameters. During the characterization phase, Radware creates an automatic, real-time signature, which blocks the DNS attack without human intervention. Using samples of real-time traffic that deviates from the baseline traffic, Radware looks for characteristic parameters of the ongoing anomaly in the suspicious traffic. Lastly, during the mitigation phase, Radware utilizes the real-time signature to identify the DNS attack traffic and automatically stops the attack.

Streamlining DDoS and ADC Environment Management and Operation with Smart RBAC

Flexible and rich out-of-the-box Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the DDoS and ADC management solution is a key fundamental enabler for large enterprises and service providers. When enterprises and service providers need to manage their global and complex deployments according to their specific business while maintaining minimal privileges to the administrators, RBAC becomes a critical enabler.
This blog showcases a few typical use cases that customers are facing in their day-to-day operations to highlight the required level of RBAC support a system should exhibit.
RBAC is most commonly used to achieve one of the following objectives:
1.Hierarchical Segregation: Offload and isolate management duties between different teams or individuals. This includes segregating functions within a team’s management or setting different privileges across regions.
2.Offload Operation Based on Skills or Roles: Certain roles can perform a larger subset of the tasks a system has, while other roles can access only part of the functions the system provides.
3.B2B Multi-Tenancy: In multi-tenant systems, each tenant should only be able to see and operate its own part of the system and not see or operate other tenant data.
4.Minimum Privileges: A critical aspect of RBAC is assuring minimal privileges to users to minimize the attack surface of your system. Admins must use RBAC to maintain minimal privileges for their administration personnel.
Here are a few typical operational use-cases requiring RBAC capabilities, using examples based on our own DefensePro product for DDoS mitigation management system and experience:
Use-Case 1: Global Organization Spread Across Two Regions
The Challenge: Each region is managed by its own team that is required to manage regional appliances (physical or virtual). Additionally, within every regional team, there are two admin users and two “view/monitor only” users.
The Solution: For each region, define two types of users:
Two users of the “Device Administrator” role to provide them with full control over the two DDoS appliances serving their region.
Two users with the “AMS Analytics” role to allow them to view and monitor dashboards, define, and generate reports and forensics, but not perform any actions.
Use-Case 2: Same as Above, but with Two Business Units
The Challenge: Each device serves two business units, with each business unit having its own admin team. The need is to be able to assign manageability scope only on a subset of the DDoS appliance.
The Solution: Define two users with the “Security Administrator” role, providing them control only over the specific sub-device-level security configuration they should manage. They will not gain visibility to other security configurations they are not assigned to. Also, define two users with “AMS Analytics” role, giving them visibility over the specific sub-device-level they are assigned to monitor. These users will not gain visibility to other traffic and attack statistics they are not assigned to.
Use-Case 3: Service Provider Offering DDoS Protection as a Service
The Challenge: When a service provider plans to offer a multi-tenant service, they need to guarantee to their tenants: isolation, where each tenant has access only to their assets, and the ability for a tenant to manage their environment, including defining their own users.
The Solution: The service provider can define the scope of assets assigned to the tenant and assign a role that will determine the capabilities for each tenant user. Additionally, the service provider can define an Admin on behalf of the tenant who will manage their own users.
Use Cases Relevant for Management of Alteon – Radware’s Application Delivery Controller (ADC) Environment
Use-Case 1: Global Organization Deploying a Combined Application Delivery and Web Application Firewall Solution
The Challenge: The need is to split the management of the devices by functional domains: Team-1 manages the load-balancer functionality, and Team-2 manages only the security aspects (Application Firewall) of the device.
The Solution: Define users that have the “Integrated WAF Administration” role, allowing them to view, manage, and configure only the security aspects of the load-balancer device. These users will not have any rights to manage the load-balancer aspects of the device. Define users with the “Device Administrator” role, providing them full manageability and control over the whole load-balancer device.
Use-Case 2: Same Organization as Above, but with Request for Visibility Only
The Challenge: The need is for specific users to gain visibility into the security aspects of the load-balancer but with no ability to perform any action.
The Solution: Define a user with the “Integrated WAF Analytics” role over the required devices. This role will provide the user only with visibility into analytics dashboards and reports for the specific devices.
Beyond the examples mentioned above, there can be many more use cases and combinations of geo splits, accountability split, and functional split that will fit your organization. System admins must adhere to the minimum privilege access policy to reduce their exposure to security risks, and RBAC is a critical tool to implement such a policy.

A Multi-Vector DDoS Attack: How Proactive Measures Saved the Day

Recently, a Radware customer located in Eastern Europe was targeted in multiple DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. The attack targeted multiple assets that hosted several types of services. The attacker’s goal was to disrupt our customer’s availability.
Our customer faced a huge attack that included three different vectors:
HTTP Flood: This vector resulted in a massive number of HTTP requests sent to a target server. Its goal was to consume resources and cause service disruption that could have resulted in financial and reputational losses.
UDP Flood: In this vector, the attacker sent large volumes of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets to a single (or random ports) on the targeted system. This would have resulted in an unresponsive server.
TCP SYN Flood: This vector resulted in a high volume of TCP connection requests sent to the target server, which would exhaust resources while the server attempted to handle all incoming connections.
The attack was executed in multiple waves, with the strongest wave peaking at over 770 gigabits per second (Gbps). Thankfully, the customer relied on Radware’s Multi-Layered DDoS Protection. The attack was successfully mitigated.

Post Attack Analysis Tells the Story
The post-attack analysis revealed the following:
1.The attackers targeted both used ports and protocols hosting actual services and non-used protocols to attempt to overwhelm firewalls protecting the customer’s assets picture)

2.Even though the attackers were no match for Radware Bot Manager, they employed several Layer 7 patterns in an attempt to evade detection, including:
a.Randomizing Referer values to different websites to make it difficult to block malicious requests based on Referer rules.
The Referer request header is an HTTP header field that indicates the address (URL) of the previous web page or resource from which a user navigated to the current page. It provides servers with information about where traffic is coming from. Attackers can easily manipulate the Referer header to disguise the source of their requests or to attempt to bypass certain security checks. As such, while it can provide insight into web traffic origins, it shouldn’t be solely relied upon for security decisions.

b.Randomizing User-Agent values and using up-to-date, legitimate-looking values to bypass User-Agent-based rules. The User-Agent request header is an HTTP header used to let the server identify the application’s name and version, the operating system (OS) and more client details with which it’s trying to communicate.

c.Randomizing non-existing URL query parameter key names, and without specifying a value. While in some cases, empty parameters can be considered as legit, in this case, the tactic’s goals were to: Overwhelm the web server and cause resource exhaustion.
i.Make blocking malicious requests based on certain query parameter names difficult (e.g., “?malicious_param”)
ii.Trigger unhandled exceptions, unexpected application behavior, or expose potential security flaws in the target system.

What This Incident Reflects
The attack our customer incurred, including how Radware Bot Manager successfully mitigated it, highlights the importance for organizations of all sizes to have proactive security measures. The key word is proactive. A reactive measure does little more than remind you what you already know — the attack was devastating.
By employing advanced protection mechanisms, including behavioral and heuristic analysis and custom security hardening, organizations can effectively defend against even the most sophisticated DDoS attacks.

TLS Flood Attacks — When Encryption Becomes a Liability
Welcome back! In my previous blog (Keeping Up with TLS Technology Trends: Insights and Analysis), we explored the latest trends in TLS technology and how it’s evolving to keep up with changing security threats. Today, we’re going to delve deeper into one of those threats — TLS flood attacks. TLS (transport layer security) flood attacks can overwhelm most DDoS protection solutions. So, if you’re using the wrong solution, it means your web applications are at risk! Let’s first take a look at what TLS flood attacks are and how they work. Then, I’ll share practical tips and insights on how you can protect your web applications against this growing threat.
The Hidden Risks of TLS Traffic — What You Need to Know
TLS can provide strong protection against many types of cyberattacks, but they are not immune to DoS (denial of service) attacks. DoS attacks, which are a type of DDoS attack, are encrypted flood attacks designed to overload a web application by sending a high volume of encrypted traffic. This type of attack looks legitimate; most are able to create legit TLS connections, even correctly responding to Layer 4 and Layer 7 challenges that are sent to confirm a user’s identity.
DDoS attacks on websites have been on the rise in recent years, with the trend increasing in the past year. Attackers are launching more frequent and sustained attacks against targeted websites; they may generate CPS (connections-per-second) or RPS (requests-per-second) floods to overwhelm a website and take it offline.
Don’t Let Smaller Sized Attacks Fool You Into Thinking the Threats Are Diminishing
According to Radware’s 2022-2023 Global Threat Analysis Report, the frequency of attacks is increasing while the size of attacks is decreasing. This drop in size sounds good, but it’s not. Attackers are simply using smaller-scale attacks and combining them with other attack vectors to maximize their impact. Don’t be fooled into a false sense of security because the number of DDoS attacks in 2022 only slightly increased. Remember, they exhibit greater strength, frequency and complexity, and encompass a wider range of attack vectors.
The following represents the number of blocked malicious web application transactions in the second half of 2022. That number grew by 201% when compared to the second half of 2021. Note that the number of malicious transactions in the fourth quarter of 2022 was higher than the total number of malicious transactions in all of 2021.

Here are some additional, potential risks that may hide behind decrypted TLS traffic:
Malware: Hackers may use TLS encryption to hide malware traffic, making it more difficult for security measures to detect and block it.
Data Theft:  Hackers may use TLS to steal data that is transmitted over the internet. This can include sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information and personal data.
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: TLS is designed to prevent MitM attacks, but it is not foolproof. If an attacker can intercept the TLS traffic, they may be able to decrypt and read the data, allowing them to steal sensitive information or manipulate communication.
Challenges When Detecting and Mitigating Encrypted Flood Attacks
Detecting and mitigating encrypted flood attacks can be challenging for several reasons. Some of the major challenges are:
1.Difficulty in Identifying Malicious Traffic (false positives/false negatives) As mentioned earlier, TLS encryption can make it difficult to identify and block malicious traffic. Encrypted flood attacks can generate a large number of false positives, which can lead to unnecessary security alerts and impact the performance of security solutions. Detecting these attacks accurately requires advanced threat detection solutions that can distinguish between legitimate traffic and malicious traffic.
2.Resource Consumption
Decryption traffic requires a significant amount of processing power and memory, including other resources. If a DDoS attack floods a server with decryption traffic, it can quickly overwhelm the server’s resources and render it unable to handle legitimate traffic.
3.Traffic Volume
A DDoS flood attack can generate an enormous amount of traffic, far more than a server can handle. If this traffic is also carrying out decryption operations, it can increase the latency and the load on the server even further, making it more difficult to mitigate the attack.
4.Cost Detecting and mitigating encrypted flood attacks can be expensive, especially in cloud environments where customers pay for processing. Organizations need to invest in advanced security solutions and infrastructure to protect against these attacks, which can be costly.
Prepare Your DDoS Appliance for Encrypted Floods
Today, most of the DDoS solutions in the market require full decryption 24/7/365 to detect and mitigate encrypted flood attacks. This is problematic for two reasons:
Customers are not willing to share the certificate — or don’t have access to the certificate — so detection and mitigation based on decryption are not feasible.
Decrypting traffic 24/7/365 to detect attacks is not recommended due to performance impact, latency (user experience), privacy concerns, technical challenges and cost.
Below are several Radware recommendations for how to efficiently secure your environment from encrypted flood attacks:
1.A Zero decryption solution is a behavioral mechanism based on machine learning (ML) that can detect and mitigate encrypted floods without decryption. It is a critical capability, especially for encrypted CPS and RPS floods.
2.A partial decryption solution is designed for optimizing the user experience by minimizing latency. Thanks to this innovative technology, it’s possible to decrypt traffic after the attack is detected and only on suspicious sessions. There isn’t any impact to the legitimate traffic. After detection, the most efficient way to proceed is to decrypt only the “first HTTPS request” and authenticate the source(s). As a last resort, you can only decrypt the suspicious sessions and mitigate the attack with traditional protections.
3.A scalable solution should be used when traffic decryption taxes CPU consumption to the maximum. In this case, it’s important that the solution have TLS accelerator hardware that supports TLS v1.3 to support the CPU by offloading the decryption processing.
4.TLS v1.3 support – if you choose this solution, you already understand the importance of TLS v1.3. Just make sure your environment supports the protocol and can decrypt TLS v1.3 traffic, if necessary.
Remember, You Need a Multi-Layered Defense Strategy
Overall, it’s important to have a multi-layered defense strategy in place. This must include using specialized DDoS protections that can detect suspicious patterns with zero decryption, mitigate encrypted flood attacks automatically and keep your websites and applications available to users.

Your Checklist for the Best “out-of-path” (OOP) DDoS Solution

In today’s world, data breaches and cyber-attacks are becoming more and more frequent, which makes it essential to choose the one DDoS solution that is right for you. If you are a service provider or a large enterprise that provides services to tenants or to other departments in your organization, you will likely want to opt-in for an “out-of-path” (OOP) DDoS deployment model.
In this blog, we will provide a few guiding rules that will help you select the most suitable OOP DDoS solution for your organization.
Let’s first understand the difference between OOP and Inline deployments
Inline deployments are when the DDoS appliance (software or hardware) is connected directly to the main pipe through which the traffic flows. This means that every packet coming into the organization goes through the DDoS appliance. The advantage of an inline deployment is that there is not a single traffic packet that avoids your DDoS appliance. This allows the DDoS appliance to create super accurate statistics using advanced algorithms, all leading to accurate detection of DDoS attacks. Some of the disadvantages related to inline deployments are cost and the potential failure of the network in case the DDoS appliance is down, which prevents any traffic from flowing through it. If your organization deploys tens or even hundreds of routers, you will need to attach a DDoS appliance to each router, which could lead to an expensive deployment.
Out-of-path (OOP) deployments typically rely on small software components that act as DDoS detectors and are “attached” to each of your organization’s routers, pulling NetFlow- and FlowSpec-related statistics. Now, the DDoS mitigation device(s) are not connected to each router but sit “outside“ the main traffic pipe (hence the name “out-of-path) waiting to be activated. To complete the deployment — there is a 3rd component — an overarching management entity, which can be considered the “brains” of the solution, performs orchestration, automation and traffic diversion if an attack takes place. Once a detector realizes that a potential DDoS attack takes place, it notifies the management entity. This results in triggering a BGP diversion of the traffic from its standard path to one of the DDoS mitigation devices (still sitting “idle”), which mitigates the attack. Once the mitigation device realizes that the attack has ended, the management entity is notified and promptly performs a re-diversion of the traffic back to its original path. The advantages of an OOP deployment are mainly in:
Cost-effectiveness (typically fewer DDoS mitigation appliances required), and
No influence on a network outage because no appliances are located inline.
Need Help Choosing The Most Suitable OOP DDoS Solution? Make Sure and Keep These Features In Mind
1.Integration with a variety of detection modules: As discussed above, an OOP solution typically relies on a software component that is communicating with the router and pulling NetFlow- and FlowSpec-based statistics. There are more than a few NetFlow- and FlowSpec-based detection components out there. Some, but not all, come specifically from DDoS vendors. It is important that the OOP DDoS solution you choose integrates with as many detectors out there as possible, or with the specific detector of your choice. You’ll want the most flexibility possible to tune the OOP DDoS solution to your liking and needs. Radware’s OOP DDoS solution is already integrated with all of the major detectors out there, including  NOKIA Deepfield, FNM FlowMon, GenieNetworks, Kentik, and more.
2.Security operation visibility and UX (user experience): A critical component of a DDoS solution (OOP or inline) is the security operation UI (user interface) and UX. Operating a DDoS security solution must be simple to use, intuitive to understand and, while providing an abundance of information, still be very much focused on what data is relevant for the attack and what the SOC operator needs to do in order to mitigate the attack swiftly. Radware’s solution introduces the state-of-the-art SecOps concept for security operations and monitoring, which provides simplicity, intuitiveness and holism, all encapsulated in a 21st-century UI that is second to none.
3.Availability of automation: A good OOP DDoS solution should provide strong automation capabilities that allow an organization to tie together detection, mitigation, diversion, reporting and re-diversion (once an attack is over). The advantages of a solid automation mechanism are clear and undeniable — reduction in the time to detect and mitigate, resiliency to errors (typically caused by human intervention) and a robust infrastructure that allows for the creation of cross-organization DDoS policies that can be realigned over time. Radware’s DDoS solution offers extensive automation capabilities.
4.Mitigation device deployment flexibility: A key capability to keep in mind when selecting an OOP DDoS solution is the flexibility needed when placing the mitigating device(s) as part of the overall solution. It is true that for the most part in OOP solutions, mitigating devices are located outside the main traffic pipe (out-of-path). However, in some cases the ability to place the mitigating device in TAP (aka TAP port) allows it to receive traffic samples, which can greatly improve the detection capabilities and, as a result, improve the overall efficiency of the DDoS solution. Radware’s OOP DDoS solution works with mitigation appliances that are either fully OOP, in TAP mode or, if needed, in mixed environments — some mitigation devices are located OOP, some in TAP mode and others inline.
5.Integration with cloud services: The integration of a DDoS OOP solution with cloud services allows service providers and the like to create a more cost-effective, overall solution by splitting the responsibility between on-premises, self-owned equipment and 3rd party cloud (SaaS) services. These typical “hybrid” solutions can allow the service provider’s own equipment to handle attacks up to a certain volume. This is also cost-effective for the service provider; attacks exceeding pre-determined volumes will be diverted to a 3rd party SaaS cloud provider. Thus, it is very important to understand if your potential DDoS OOP vendor also offers cloud (SaaS) services. Radware offers extensive cloud services that encompass DDoS, WAF, API protection and bot management services.
Remember, You Need Both Cost-Effectiveness and Efficiency
When choosing an OOP DDoS security solution, it’s important to focus on key features and capabilities that will ensure you have the most cost-effective and efficient solution. Keeping these features top-of-mind during the vetting process will help you select the right OOP DDoS Security Solution for your organization — integration with many detectors, automation, a superb UX for security operations and integration with cloud Services.

DDoS Carpet-Bombing – Coming In Fast And Brutal

In recent years, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have become more frequent and sophisticated. Attackers continue to find new ways to flood target networks with massive-scale attacks that grow exponentially and use different attack techniques. Carpet-bombing is one of those destructive technics. It is a major concern for enterprises and service providers worldwide and DDoS vendors must handle this distributed and overwhelming attack technique.
The impact of DDoS carpet-bombing attacks can be devastating to an organization — they cause extended downtime to large parts of the network and inflict financial losses and reputational damage. That’s why it’s critical that organizations are prepared to detect and mitigate these vicious attacks with a state-of-the-art mitigation solution.
Understanding DDoS Carpet-Bombing Techniques
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target’s resources, making their services inaccessible to legitimate users. carpet-bombing takes the traditional DDoS attack to a whole new level by leveraging a vast botnet network to orchestrate simultaneous attacks on multiple targets. The sheer scale and complexity of this approach make it particularly challenging to defend against.
How Does DDoS Carpet-Bombing Work?
What makes the DDoS carpet-bombing a special attack vector is the fact it is targeting multiple targets at the same time, unlike conventional DDoS attacks that usually hit one, or several, targets to take down a service or application. Here are three elements that help identify a carpet-bombing attack.
1. Botnet Recruitment:
Attackers recruit a massive number of compromised devices, including computers, servers, routers and IoT devices, without the owners’ knowledge. These devices are then aggregated into a botnet.
2. Attack Execution:
Once the botnet is recruited, the attacker will most likely stand down and wait with the attack command because they assume that the target has a mitigation solution. The attacker will then send a scattered attack, as opposed to sending to individual destination IPs, to try and measure the configured thresholds; they’re looking for what can and cannot be breached. Ultimately, they’re looking for that sweet spot that is just below the configured rate threshold. Once this is found, the attacker will back off or maybe sustain it for a period of time (hours to days) to understand if they were spotted and blocklisted.
Now for the strike command. The attacker initiates the same volume of malicious traffic, this time bombarding the entire subnet(s) or CIDR/s (thousands of destination IPs) at the same time. By staying below the threshold, all attacked servers try to respond, which creates an overwhelming flood that will cause internal services, including the mitigation device, to suffer This flood of traffic overwhelms the target’s network infrastructure, rendering online services inaccessible.
3. Multi-Vector Approach:
DDoS carpet-bombing employs multiple attack vectors, including volumetric attacks (flooding the network with excessive traffic), application-layer attacks (targeting specific applications or services) and protocol attacks (exploiting vulnerabilities in networking protocols). This multifaceted approach maximizes the chances of success.

Consequences of DDoS Carpet-Bombing:
Protecting against carpet-bombing DDoS attacks is more difficult than protecting a focused attack, simply because most DDoS vendors mitigate against individual IPs and not subnets and networks. Therefore, the spotlight of detection and mitigation is on individual IPs rather than networks.
1. Service Disruption: Organizations targeted by DDoS carpet-bombing experience significant service disruptions, leading to financial losses, tarnished reputations and customer dissatisfaction. The unavailability of critical services can cause severe operational challenges.
2. Collateral Damage: Since DDoS carpet-bombing simultaneously targets multiple entities, collateral damage is a common occurrence. Even if a target manages to mitigate the attack, the sheer volume of malicious traffic affects the broader infrastructure, causing slowdowns or outages for other users and services.
Preventive Measures:
1. Proactive Network Monitoring: Data is power, and you’ll need a DDoS detector and mitigator that displays network monitoring in peacetime and capable of detecting abnormal traffic patterns and identifying potential DDoS attacks in real-time. Early detection enables rapid response. The next step is to have an automatic mitigation counteraction.
2. Scalable Bandwidth and Infrastructure: Organizations should ensure their network infrastructure can handle unexpected spikes in traffic. Investing in scalable bandwidth, load balancers and a strong detection and mitigation device which will handle the high-scale attack and ensure service availability.
3. DDoS Mitigation Services: Engaging with a reputable DDoS mitigation service provider is crucial. These services employ advanced traffic filtering techniques and have the expertise to handle large-scale attacks. A leading DDoS vendor solution should identify and block malicious traffic, ensuring legitimate requests reach their intended destinations. This keeps the attack traffic out.
Just recently, Radware Cloud Services successfully mitigated a very large carpet-bombing campaign that targeted several enterprises and service providers simultaneously. It was a global attack campaign that focused on TCP reflection of large subnets and CIDRs as the main attack vector.
The attack method used a large subnet/CIDR to reflect a flood of SYN-ACK packets at the target victims with a scale of over 300Gbps floods. The attacks were blocked immediately with several mitigation techniques. Non-protected organizations experienced slowdowns or downtimes.

Carpet-Bombing = collateral damage to non-protected organizations.
Conclusion
The threat of a DDoS carpet-bombing continues to grow in part because they stay below mitigation thresholds. These highly distributed attacks against large portions of the victim’s network, such as subnets/CIDRs, are highly devastating if they are not detected and mitigated.
Carpet-bombing attacks used by sophisticated hackers or hacktivism groups are a common attack vector that increases year over year.
Organizations, small to large, must take the necessary steps to protect themselves. By implementing an innovative detection mechanism, having a multi-layered approach protection and using a robust mitigation platform, organizations will be ready for the next carpet-bombing knocking on their roof.

4 Ways To Categorize Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks — Part 1

It’s probably not news that the amount and frequency of cyber-attacks are rising precipitously. And one type of attack, the Web DDoS Tsunami, represents a notoriously large component of this growth. At Radware, we see and live this every day. Here’s the great news — our customers are protected against them by our Cloud WAF and DDoS Protection solutions.
It’s inaccurate to suggest that any DDoS attack is easy to combat, but definitely easier to argue that the new generation of HTTPS Floods are extremely difficult to detect and mitigate. Since HTTPS Floods have been around for a few years, they are sometimes considered “old news”. Consider this, though — the volume and intensity of HTTPS Floods are up dramatically, and the level of sophistication introduced by attackers is growing fast and viciously. We strongly believe that the “old” HTTP/S Floods are turning into Web DDoS Tsunamis. And, of course, a tsunami is something everyone should be prepared for ahead of time and have the proper protection in place.
It’s now a much bigger threat than most IT professionals realize.
What Can Be Categorized as a Web DDoS Tsunami Attack?
To understand Web DDoS Tsunami attacks — and HTTP Flood attacks in general — it helps to first understand the 4 ways in which these attacks can be categorized: attack volume, attack duration, characterization of the botnet used by the attackers and how attack transactions are crafted to look like legitimate requests.
In this blog — the first of two on the subject — we’ll take a look at Attack Volume and Attack Duration.
Attack Volume
In just the past few months there have been several million RPS (requests per second) HTTPS Flood attacks observed and publicized by various 3rd party organizations. At Radware, we have also experienced such million-RPS attacks targeting our customers. A number of these huge, observed attacks even reached upwards of tens of million RPS. Correspondingly, several record-breaking attacks were recently disclosed by public cloud vendors. No doubt we are in the era when HTTPS Flood attacks are turning into Web DDoS Tsunamis. Of course, these mega-RPS attack levels represent extreme HTTPS Floods, but keep in mind that the number of very high-volume RPS attacks is high and keeps growing. Just last year, several studies demonstrated that 95% of HTTPS Floods clocked in at under 150k RPS (the 99% percentile can reach more than 500k RPS). Over just the last few months, there has been a steep rise in the average RPS rate. Numerous attacks reached hundreds of thousands, even millions, RPS. We can say with reasonable confidence that almost all web applications, web services or any other online assets on Earth can be targeted by this wave of massive volume Web DDoS Tsunamis! The need for Web DDoS Tsunami protection is truly a “must have” need of our industry.

Figure 1: Real-life Web Tsunami example that Radware successfully mitigated for our customer, who was targeted. The attack was in excess of 500k RPS and lasted over an hour.
This rise in Web DDoS Tsunamis greatly impacts not just online asset owners, but also WAF and DDoS Protection solution vendors. They have the added responsibility of protecting both their customers’ online assets and their own infrastructure from these sophisticated, high-RPS DDoS attacks. Each WAF and DDoS protection provider must ensure that if several tenants share the same infrastructure and there’s an attack on one tenant, there’s probably an attack on another. On top of that, application layer (L7) infrastructures, because they are more complicated and expensive to build and manage, are way more complex and expensive when it comes to mitigating Web DDoS Tsunamis than those of their more traditional network layer (L3) counterparts.
Building Web Tsunami attack detection and mitigation services requires special care, expertise and large investments in the proper infrastructure. The objective is to eliminate the protection infrastructure from being overwhelmed and saturated by the attack’s massive volume of traffic before getting to actual customer protection. Only high-capacity L7 entities (web proxies, and others), along with highly architected and ruggedized protection infrastructures, can successfully face such ridiculous attack volumes. Only highly skilled and experienced vendors in both DDoS and L7 AppSec protection can satisfy the L7 infrastructure and attack mitigation requirements generated by this new era of Web DDoS Tsunamis.
Attack Duration
A Web DDoS Tsunami can last anywhere from a few seconds to hours, even several days. It’s a broad timeframe. While some of the infamous ultra-high RPS (millions) attacks generally last less than a minute, other recent Web DDoS Tsunami attacks have lasted for several minutes or many hours. At Radware, we have also experienced tsunami attacks on our protected customers that lasted more than a day.

Figure 2 (image blurred to protect customer’s identity): Real-life Web Tsunami attack example against one of Radware’s customers. The attack lasted for over a day and didn’t stop. Throughout this 25-hour attack, more than one billion attack requests were successfully mitigated by Radware’s Web DDoS service. This image is taken from the Radware WEB DDoS service portal.
Duration aside, there is also a very steep rise in tsunami volume. In many cases, the attack bursts in a flash to “full power” in less than 10 seconds, then stayed there. One can only imagine an unprotected website during high traffic times suddenly jumping to 500k or a million RPS in less than 10 seconds. The results are obvious; the site will go down and be unresponsive to legitimate users, who stay frustrated for hours or simply move to another provider to obtain the services they need.
There are also attacks that last for a few seconds. Many wonder about the motivation behind these abbreviated attacks. It’s up for debate, but a common assumption is that short, aggressive attacks are used to demonstrate what the attacker is capable of accomplishing. Attackers are using Telegram (or other media channels) to showcase their ability to launch devastating attacks by displaying that the victim’s application is down and unresponsive within seconds after they’ve launched a tsunami attack. In some other cases, short attacks can be a “ransom threat message”. It’s their way of showing the potential victim that “this is what we can do if you will not pay the ransom we asked for.” It’s a scare tactic indeed.
Again, protecting against such brutal tsunami attacks is not an easy and straightforward task. It requires a high degree of DDoS and AppSec protection expertise. Every Web DDoS Tsunami protection infrastructure must be able to cope with and absorb an ultra-steep increase in the incoming load, be ready to hold this volume for a diverse period of time and do it all in an efficient and cost-effective way. And this needs to be done while keeping customers’ online assets safely up and running.  
Next Up — Part 2 of 4 Ways To Categorize Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks
Next week, we’ll publish the second and final blog in this series, which will cover the last 2 ways to categorize Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks — the characterization of the botnet used by attackers and how the sophisticated, legitimate-looking attack transactions are created.
Protecting against these attacks is just one of an array of reasons so many organizations rely on Radware.

Protection from the latest disruptive Web DDoS Tsunami attacks and other cyberattacks is just a click away.

4 Ways To Categorize Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks — Part 2
In Part 1 of 4 Ways to Categorize Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks, I covered the first two ways they can be categorized — Attack Volume and Attack Duration. The following will cover the next two ways to categorize Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks — the characteristics of the botnet used and the attack transactions.  
Characteristics of the Botnet Used
There is an array of dimensions that can be used to characterize botnets launching Web DDoS Tsunamis floods. The following are dimensions relevant primarily for attack detection and mitigation. Other dimensions (like botnet owners’ political or religious affiliation, financial motivation, extortion, and more) that are less relevant regarding attack detection are discussed in other Radware posts and blogs.
First, we should consider the size of the botnet. It’s characterized by the number of unique IPs from which the attack’s web transactions originate. The number of attacker IPs used can typically range from thousands to hundreds of thousands. IPs can be distributed geographically across the globe or assigned to numerous autonomous system numbers (ASNs), which are typically owned by service providers and identify networks that exist on the internet. As a result, during Web DDoS Tsunamis each of the attacker’s IPs can generate similar, higher or lower RPS levels, as do legitimate clients on average (This is when compared to legitimate clients’ average RPS during peacetime). Consequently, treating top talker IPs (i.e., client IPs with the highest RPS received in a timeframe) as the attackers as a mitigation technique — including providing other, traditional mitigation approaches like rate-limiting source IPs with high RPS levels — can potentially yield an unwanted level of false positive. This can potentially harm the availability of the protected service and the resultant frustration — which was the attacker’s original objective — will have been fulfilled. In some real-life cases we have seen in Radware, attackers generate Web DDoS Tsunami attacks from large-scale botnets, as each individual bot generates very low RPS volumes in order to evade simple approaches used to mitigate such attacks.

Along with botnet size, Web DDoS Tsunamis can originate from source IPs that are potentially assigned, or owned, by various types of sources. Probably the most common attacks are those in which the attacker’s IPs belong to public proxies, such as an open proxy, an anonymous proxy or an open VPN. This is commonly used by attackers to obfuscate their true identities. In addition, the attacker’s IP can belong to legitimate residential subscribers (i.e., home routers belonging to an innocent, unknowing subscriber), cloud provider IPs, web hosting provider IPs and (less common) infected IoT devices. The attackers primarily use these various types of IPs to obfuscate themselves from being identified and simply blocked (and potentially arrested by country-based law enforcement authorities). As a result, an attack won’t be detected and mitigated if threat intelligence information is used merely to mitigate it based on IP address affiliation. It may help, however, for mitigating attacks coming from an incriminated anonymous proxy. However, it won’t help in cases when the attack arrives from legitimate, residential IPs, which are the legitimate clients of most online services. Building a mitigation strategy based solely on IP address intelligence can potentially yield an unwanted level of false negatives. IP reputation can help fight — but not fight on its own — against these next generation tsunami attacks.
Tsunami attacks coming concurrently from several orchestrated botnets is also a reality. In order to build a tsunami-level HTTP attack, different hacker groups sometimes cooperate and attack a single victim at the same time. As a result, multiple types of attacker IP addresses and high volumes of RPS can appear within a single attack. Indeed, this makes it convoluted and challenging to handle.  
Attack Transactions
Maybe the most interesting Web DDoS Tsunami Attack category is how the attacker crafts the HTTP transactions generated by their botnet during the onset of the WEB attacks tsunami.
When trying to explore the structure of the web DDoS HTTP request, we once again find a wide spectrum of approaches. Let’s start with a very simple case when a Web DDoS Tsunami is composed from a simple HTTP request. The attack is built from a single transaction that is transmitted, or replicated, in high volume. For example, it can be a simple HTTP GET to the “/” along with a very basic set of HTTP headers, such as Host and Accept. On the one hand, these transactions look legitimate, so it’s not likely that the attack can be mitigated by a traditional WAAF, or by other existing means. On the other hand, mitigation entities might be able to simply block, or filter, this specific single transaction before it is delivered to the protected organization’s online assets. In that case, the attack will be mitigated. However, nowadays Web DDoS Tsunamis are way more sophisticated. The attackers avoid this simple detection and mitigation by building more complex and genuine transactions. Also, they heavily rely on randomization. A wide range of an attack’s transaction structure appears in web tsunami attacks. Attackers craft more realistic and legitimate transactions that contain a set of “legitimate looking” query arguments, more HTTP headers, User Agent and referer headers, web cookies, and more. The attack requests have various HTTP methods (POST, PUT, HEAD, etc.) and direct to a number of paths within the protected application. Many attributes of the transactions generated by the attacker are continuously randomized, sometimes on a single transaction basis. Using this high level of randomization makes simple mitigation impractical. The tsunami DDoS attacks appear as legitimate traffic requests and are constantly randomized. As a result, when aiming to perfect mitigation there is no simple, pre-defined signature or rule-based mechanism to provide attack mitigation because the requests appear legitimate and do not indicate malicious intent.
One of the things that makes these attacks so difficult and confounding to mitigate is that once the encrypted traffic is decrypted, it still looks legitimate. Web DDoS Tsunami attackers leverage large amounts of sophisticated evasion techniques to bypass traditional application protections. To add to the sophistication of these attacks, the attackers change their attack pattern during the attack or use several attack request structures together. And it gets even more complex when attacks are launched by several orchestrated botnets in which several of the attacker’s strategies appear simultaneously. As a result of all these attacker strategies, Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks can contain millions of distinct transactions, all of which appear legitimate. If not treating these attacks as a type of zero-day attack and exclusively using a pre-defined set of filters (based perhaps on past attacks) to mitigate attacks, it can potentially result in high levels of unwanted false negatives in mitigation. Just think of a 3 million RPS attack with 1% false negatives; many online assets will not be able to survive the level of traffic leaking after this non-perfect mitigation. 
Here’s Your Best Option to Protect Against Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks
It’s important to understand the 4 ways Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks can be categorized, but more important to know how to protect your organization from them. Don’t put it off. Remember, they are on the rise. To protect against them, organizations need a solution that can quickly adapt in real time to an attack campaign. Remember, standard on-prem or cloud-based DDoS and WAAF solutions can’t do that. These threats are dynamic; they change and evolve. Their frequency can’t be predicted, attack vectors are randomized, source IPs and other parameters change, and their ability to sustain these changes can be maintained over long periods of time. Only behavioral-based algorithms with self-learning and auto-tuning can detect and mitigate these attacks.
That’s why it’s so important to learn how Radware successfully protects our customers from Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks.

Putting an End to the Flood-Radware Successfully Stops Record-Breaking 15 Billion Request Web DDoS Tsunami Campaign

In the ever-changing world of cybersecurity threats, Layer 7 distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks continue to be a major challenge for online businesses. These advanced attacks cause significant disruptions, make services unavailable, create a poor user experience and lead to financial losses.
Now here’s the good news — Radware Web DDoS Protection has what it takes to stop these large and persistent Web DDoS Tsunamis. In fact, here’s an example of a recent one we successfully mitigated for a customer.
Hacktivist Threats Include Ransom Requests
Our customer had become the focus of an online hacktivist group. But as time passed, their motives shifted from political to financial, at which point they delivered DDoS ransom requests to the customer. The ransoms totaled millions of dollars, so having reliable, tested and proven defense was critically necessary.
We quickly activated Radware’s new Web DDoS Protection service to eliminate the threat and handle multiple attacks, which had reached peak rates of 2.8 million requests per second (RPS). This protection ensured that the customer’s online services remained available and without any interruptions.
In the following, we will explore details of the attack campaign, describe our approach to mitigating the attacks and share the outstanding results we achieved.
The key takeaway is quite evident — despite facing large-scale attacks, the customer’s online services remained fully operational, even in the midst of multiple ongoing attacks. They expressed sincere appreciation and gratitude for our consistent and unwavering support.
Attack Analysis
Throughout the attack campaign, Radware mitigated a staggering volume of requests — 15 billion! This highlights the immense scale of the threat directed at our customer. The campaign, which took place from June 2nd through June 5th, targeted multiple customer applications and consisted of three significant waves.
The three waves lasted for 2.5 hours, 1.5 hours and 0.5 hours, respectively. When considering the cumulative attack duration across all applications, the total spanned almost 20 hours. The attack demonstrated a remarkable level of intensity with a rate of 2.8 million RPS across all targeted applications. The highest peak per application reached a staggering 2.6 million RPS during the attack campaign’s second wave.

Figure 1: The figure shows the three campaign waves across five applications peaking to 2.8 million RPS. Over time, the total amount of blocked requests reached 15 billion.

Figure 2: The figure shows the highest peak on a single application (out of five attacked applications) for each wave. The highest peak on a single application stood at 2.6 million RPS.
Radware’s Mitigation Strategy
Radware’s immediate and decisive response played a crucial role in swiftly and comprehensively escorting our customer’s organization from emergency onboarding to Radware’s Cloud Web DDoS Protection Service. Remarkably, this was accomplished without the luxury of any learning period. Leveraging Radware’s automatic, real-time signature-creation capabilities, customized signatures were seamlessly activated and precisely tailored to counteract the unique characteristics of the attack.
Throughout the entire attack campaign, Radware’s automatic mitigation actions were powered by advanced algorithms that analyzed the behavior of the attacks. We successfully mitigated all attacks without any   prior knowledge or assumptions about it. The attack pattern was learned and handled automatically without any human intervention.

Through close collaboration with the customer and continuous monitoring, Radware’s dedicated Emergency Response Team (ERT) actively worked to ensure their seamless operation and optimal protection.
Our automatic signatures effectively blocked the waves of attack, which allowed legitimate users to continue accessing the service.
The ability to defend against evolving threats immediately, and without the need for a learning period, demonstrates Radware’s expertise in providing reliable protection.
Attack Analysis
The attack originated from a large-scale botnet spanning multiple countries, including, among others, Sweden, the United States, Denmark, Morocco, Poland and Italy. Approximately 30,000 source IPs participated in the attack, with some hosted on public clouds and cloud security service providers; this indicates widespread misuse.
The attackers employed various methods to increase the impact of their attacks and evade regular security measures, including:
Encrypted requests (HTTPS), which required more computing resources.
HTTP GET requests designed to appear legitimate.
Techniques that included HTTP/2 multiplexing, which enhanced effectiveness.
Alteration of request patterns at different stages of the attack.
It’s important to note that, despite these changing tactics, Radware’s algorithm swiftly detected and updated security measures in real-time. And — as always — we applied the updated real-time signatures automatically and shared the related information and statistics with the customer.
This adaptive approach ensured our readiness to handle the evolving attack. We continuously adapted to changing tactics and provided our customer clear visibility into the attack waves and patterns.

Securing VoIP and Unified Communications Networks
The trend toward remote work, which was initiated by the pandemic, still persists today. To minimize in-person interactions, individuals and companies are increasingly relying on remote access. Consequently, there has been a rise in attacks on converged networks that integrate voice and data, making them vulnerable to malware and security breaches at the network and application levels. As a result, VoIP services are prone to disruptions from both known and unknown (zero-day) attacks, just like other areas of information security. This places greater emphasis on service providers to meet evolving cybersecurity requirements in order to enhance the customer experience (CX).
Collaboration Tools Have Quality and Reliability Challenges
VoIP and video conferencing systems, including Unified Communication as a Service (UCaaS), rely on two protocols — Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Real-Time Protocol (RTP). While both protocols support Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for direct communication, their primary choice is User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It’s better for real-time or live data transmission that can’t afford delays. However, UDP lacks packet delivery assurance and packet ordering capabilities found in TCP, which can lead to quality issues in VoIP and video conferencing systems. UDP is more about speed, TCP is more about reliability.
Collaboration Tools are Vulnerable to DDoS Attacks
The UDP protocol used by these systems is vulnerable to various types of attacks. This includes Layer 4, volumetric attacks, such as UDP Floods, UDP Garbage Floods, Reflection Floods and direct Layer 7 attacks targeting RTP and SIP (e.g., SIP Invite and Register Floods). In addition to these attacks, common UDP Flood attacks may include sending garbage payloads or leveraging reflection and amplification attacks on service protocols, like DNS, NTP, SSDP and Memcached for amplification attacks.

Attackers exploit normal behavior to cause congestion on targeted networks. They achieve this by sending numerous UDP datagrams from either legitimate or spoofed IP addresses to random ports on a target server. The excessive traffic overwhelms the server, preventing it from processing every request and consuming all available bandwidth. Consequently, the server sends “destination unreachable” packet replies via ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), which confirms that no application was listening on the targeted ports.
Radware DefensePro: Comprehensive Protection for VoIP and Unified Communications Networks
Radware’s DefensePro solution offers a multi-layer defense system that addresses both known and unknown VoIP attacks through behavior- and signature-based approaches. By combining both approaches with machine learning (ML) capabilities, DefensePro provides advanced threat detection and prevention mechanisms. More importantly, it operates seamlessly in high-speed environments, minimizing the impact of traffic latency and ensuring scalability.

With DefensePro, accurate detection and prevention technologies are employed, which significantly reduces false positives and effectively prevents voice quality degradation.

3 Reasons Your Public Cloud Provider Won’t Protect You From A DDoS Attack
The use of public clouds, whether by a very small company or a large enterprise, is more popular now than ever. Its popularity is due to the scalability, flexibility and cost-effectiveness public cloud providers deliver. However, it is exactly this popularity that has led them to become attractive targets for cybercriminals looking to launch DDoS attacks. This has made many public cloud providers invest in security measures to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks on their customers. But are these measures really good enough when you are under attack?
The truth is, no matter how attractive it is to have everything — infrastructure, compute, storage and security — taken care of by a single vendor, the public cloud providers fall short. As a result, the basic security provided by public cloud providers is not sufficient when you’re hit by a sophisticated DDoS attack.
There are a few key reasons why DDoS protection by public cloud providers may not protect you from a DDoS attack.
1. It’s Not Their Focus Area
Ultimately, the core business of public cloud providers is selling their compute and storage services. It’s a straightforward business model where the more cloud services the customer consumes, the more money they make. Security is not their core business, but rather a “side business” that increases their customers’ cloud consumption.

Today, we see DDoS attacks getting more sophisticated with attackers constantly finding new ways to bypass existing security measures. It requires the skills and expertise of a security-first vendor to develop ways to mitigate such attacks and minimize their impact on customers. Given that cloud providers are not specialized security vendors, they lack the expertise that comes from dealing with complex and sophisticated cyberattacks that leave their customers exposed for extended periods of time while they’re under attack.
2. Protection Coverage is Poor, Low Quality
Most public cloud providers today provide some level of protection against DDoS attacks. This may be sufficient to protect against the most basic, frequently-occurring network and transport layer attacks, but it won’t protect against more advanced attacks, such as burst attacks, DNS and encrypted attacks, multi-vector attacks and zero-day attacks.
Cloud providers offer basic protection as part of their standard offering, but the advanced protection is available as an expensive add-on. With large-scale, frequent, complex and advanced multi-vector attacks targeting public clouds on the rise, even the advanced tier DDoS protection they have does not provide the level of protection that customers require. This, of course, leaves them exposed when under attack.
Additionally, the public cloud providers provide DDoS protection that is designed to protect their own infrastructure and not their customer’s applications hosted in their private data center or another cloud infrastructure. This makes relying on DDoS protection from public cloud providers a rather bad option for customers with hybrid- and multi-cloud environments. Doing so means to stay fully protected they will need to manage multiple different solutions with different security policies and inconsistent visibility.
3. Support is Limited and SLAs Have No Guarantees
Any downtime caused by DDoS attacks can cost your organization a fortune. The faster the detection and mitigation time for attacks, the better your bottom line will be. Therefore, it is very important to understand what your provider is willing to commit to.
Public cloud providers offer no commitments for their basic protection at all. However, if you purchase their advanced tier of DDoS protection, they provide “best effort” SLA commitments, but only for uptime. Their SLA does not include attack detection time, mitigation time, alerting, or quality of mitigation. The lack of these metrics should immediately raise a red flag about the quality of protection they’re providing. Moreover, when they do not meet their uptime commitment, they provide remediation in service credits; this amounts to a mere fraction of what they’re due and in no way compensates for any losses that may have been caused by a service disruption. It’s like buying car insurance that only covers the tires.
 
Managed services and emergency support are applicable only on advanced DDoS protection tiers. So, it’s only possible to have these support services if you are subscribed to the business and enterprise support plans. Of course, you’ll have to pay for these separately.
Cheap Can be Expensive
Contrary to the general perception people have that the public cloud is inexpensive, it is in fact quite expensive when it comes to DDoS protection. As covered earlier, the free tier is extremely basic and if you need better protection you have to purchase the advanced protection tier. This becomes quite expensive because you’ll need to pay a monthly fee for each account or resource. Moreover, if you need more visibility into the traffic and protection measures used, it’s only possible if you turn on and pay for an additional service. The additional charges add up pretty quick.
 As you’ve probably guessed by now, support and managed services are also add-ons you will need to pay for on top of this. The sad part is that even after paying for all the add-ons, you still end up getting inferior protection that may not protect against all types of DDoS attacks. It’s a roll of the dice. Gambling shouldn’t be part of your security plan.
It’s very important to understand your specific needs and risk profile before turning to a public cloud provider for DDoS protection. Although some may consider DDoS protection from a public cloud provider as a good starting point, you’ll definitely need to evaluate a security leader like Radware.
There is a reason so many organizations, enterprises and governments rely on Radware to provide industry-leading IT security to remain safe and operating at optimal levels. Our experts have one goal in mind — keep customers secure by detecting and stopping attacks before they overwhelm their infrastructure. Reach out to them HERE. They would love to hear from you. Protection from DDoS and other attacks is just a click away.


- https://www.radware.com/blog/ddos-protection/2023/05/the-new-frontier-of-ddos-attacks-is-serverless/
The New Frontier of DDoS Attacks is Serverless

Hackers are now using serverless computing as a means of launching DDoS attacks. This new trend has significant implications regarding the scale of these attacks and the complexity of mitigating them.
Radware recently mitigated a large-scale and prolonged web DDoS attack against one of our customers. The attack was remarkable not just for the size and duration of the attack, but also because it was launched by the serverless computing infrastructure of a large public cloud provider.
We believe that this attack is a harbinger of a greater trend — the adoption of serverless computing by DDoS attackers. The significant problem is that beyond the technical novelty of this approach, it introduces the potential for bigger attacks that are more easily launched and more difficult to mitigate.
A Short History of DDoS Attacks
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks have been around since the dawn of computing. The very first DoS attack occurred as early as 1974 by a 13-year-old middle-school student. He launched the attack against the PLATO mainframe at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s Computer-Based Education Research Laboratory (CERL).
While that attack was more a prank and experiment by a curious teenager, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks have evolved over the years into large-scale and technically complex criminal activities. Moreover, hackers have learned to use globally distributed botnets to launch large-scale attacks and complicate mitigation efforts, hence the additional ‘D’ in DDoS, standing for Distributed Denial of Service attacks.
Today, hacker groups and criminal rings routinely maintain large-scale, globally distributed botnets to launch DDoS attacks. These botnets are typically based on both compromised PCs and vulnerable IoT (internet of things) devices, including routers, IP cameras, refrigerators, and even electric vehicles.
The downside of this approach, however, is that building such a botnet requires considerable effort by hackers. They have to scan for vulnerable devices, access them, find vulnerabilities to exploit and develop binaries that will run on the devices. Moreover, maintaining such a botnet can be surprisingly difficult, as hacker groups often compete with, and steal, each other’s compromised devices.
Mitigating a Serverless DDoS Attack
On April 21st, 2023, Radware detected a DDoS attack targeting one of our customers, a global communications provider protected by our Cloud Application Protection service.
The attack was a fairly sizable HTTPS GET flood with dynamic parameters. It consisted of four major peaks. Each peak was over 110K requests per second (RPS) and reached as high as 140K RPS. While it wasn’t the largest attack we’ve seen, it was certainly significant and could have easily brought down unprotected web applications. Also, it was a very persistent attack, lasting nearly 3 days.

Figure 1: Incoming waves of DDoS attack traffic originating from serverless computing services, peaking at over 140K requests per second (RPS)
The attack was remarkable for more than just the size and persistence of the assault. It didn’t originate from a botnet, but from the serverless computing service of a large public infrastructure provider — Cloudflare.
Radware observed large numbers of requests originating from IP ranges associated with Cloudflare Workers, the company’s serverless computing service.
Attack traffic came from both multiple IP subnets and multiple geographies worldwide. When combined with the dynamic nature of the HTTPS GET requests, mitigating the attack using traditional DDoS defense tools would have been very challenging at best.
Radware mitigated the attack using our behavioral-based web DDoS protection algorithms combined with custom signatures put in place by our Emergency Response Team (ERT).
While the attack was successfully mitigated, it provided a glimpse of future trends and how hackers are beginning to leverage serverless computing to launch DDoS attacks.
Serverless Computing has Advantages for Hackers, Too
Serverless computing has been one of the hot trends of the past few years. Organizations and developers are enticed by its decreased overhead, fast deployment and the scalability it offers, and many infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers offer it, including AWS, Azure, Cloudflare, and others.
The problem, however, is that many of the advantages serverless computing offers developers also apply to hackers.
Compared to the overhead of maintaining their own botnets, serverless computing offers hackers the following key advantages:
They don’t need an infrastructure of their own. Serverless computing removes from hackers the burden of maintaining their own botnet infrastructure (and defending it against other hackers), which allows them to use a publicly available infrastructure.
It’s easier to create. With serverless code, hackers no longer need to detect exposed devices, exploit them and create full-stack binaries to run on routers, IP cameras, and other IoT devices. With serverless computing, all that’s needed is for the hacker to write high-level application code; the infrastructure provider takes care of the rest.
They have instant scale at their fingertips. The instant scalability afforded by serverless computing enables attackers to launch devastatingly massive attacks with ease.
Serverless Computing Complicates Mitigation Efforts
Apart from offering attackers opportunities to enhance the potency of DDoS attacks, serverless computing also presents the following key challenges to defenders, which complicates mitigation efforts:
They are large in scale. The scalability of serverless computing services allows attackers to create large-scale attacks with ease, which means organizations will have to protect against larger attacks more than ever.
They are highly distributed. With serverless scripts, attackers can create highly distributed attacks that come from multiple sources at once and utilize large pools of IP addresses and geographic locations. This means traditional DDoS mitigation tools, such as access control lists (ACLs) or geo-blocking, will be rendered useless because they won’t be able to cover all attack sources.
They can hide behind legitimate traffic. By using publicly available serverless computing services offered by cloud infrastructure providers like AWS, Azure, Cloudflare, and others, attackers can hide behind legitimate traffic that also originates from these networks. This makes distinguishing between legitimate and attack traffic very difficult and attempt to completely block those providers means large numbers of requests by legitimate users or services will be blocked, as well. This results in high false positive rates.
Application layer requests. Serverless computing eliminates the need for developers to create the lower levels of application code (e.g., operating system, network interfaces, etc.) and focus directly on application layer code. This enables attackers to easily write scripts that target the application layer and bypass the traditional network layer. This means they can create DDoS attacks that home in on the business logic of targeted web applications.
These challenges brought about by serverless-based DDoS attacks mean that traditional DDoS mitigation techniques won’t block these sophisticated attacks. That’s why organizations must seek new ways to protect themselves.
You Need Behavioral Detection To Cut Through the Noise
While serverless computing makes writing applications and services more easily, it also enables attackers to launch DDoS attacks that are not only larger, but harder to mitigate. The characteristics of serverless scripts launched from public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) providers make it difficult to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic.
This means organizations need mitigation techniques that look beyond the IP address, source or geo-location. They need a solution that can distinguish between good and bad requests based on traffic characteristics.

Hackers Launch Sophisticated DDoS Attacks Using Serverless Computing

The growing popularity of serverless computing has not gone unnoticed by hackers, who have begun using such infrastructures for launching DDoS attacks.
Radware recently stopped a large-scale web DDoS attack, which was launched using serverless service workers. It’s another example of the growing sophistication and audacity of attackers. This attack also demonstrates the potential for attackers in utilizing serverless computing to launch large-scale DDoS attacks, and the risks they pose.
A Prolonged, Large-Scale Attack
On Friday, April 21st, Radware detected a large-scale volumetric HTTPS GET flood directed at one of our Cloud Application Protection customers. The customer is an international communications service provider, and the attack targeted their user management portal.
It was a prolonged attack, lasting from Friday, April 21st until Sunday, April 23rd. Attackers frequently launch attacks on weekends, trying to take advantage of smaller staff numbers and less attention. However, this customer was protected by Radware’s Cloud Application Protection, so Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) was on standby and provided immediate 24/7 assistance.  
Over the course of 3 days, the customer was hit with four major waves of attacks, some of them lasting several hours and each peaking at over 110K requests per second (RPS) and reaching as high as 140K RPS:
1st Wave: April 21, peaking at 120K RPS
2nd Wave: April 22 (noon), peaking at 110K RPS
3rd Wave: April 22 (afternoon), peaking at 140K RPS
4th Wave: April 22-23 (midnight), peaking at 130K RPS

Figure 1: The first attack wave from April 21, which peaked at over 122K requests per second (RPS)

Figure 2: The attack waves from April 22 and April 23, which peaked at over 140K requests per second (RPS)
While DDoS attacks are commonly measured in the amount of throughput (typically Megabits/Gigabits/Terabits per second), another important measure – particularly for application layer attacks – is the number of requests per second (RPS). Although Radware has seen (and mitigated) attacks several times larger than this one, attacks peaking at 140K RPS (and over a sustained time period) are still very sizable attacks that can easily overwhelm most application servers.
Serverless Workers Serving DDoS Attacks
Another unique characteristic of this attack is that it didn’t originate from a botnet, but by serverless scripts running from a public infrastructure. In this case, the serverless scripts were based on Cloudflare Workers.
Radware observed large numbers of requests originating from IP ranges and subnets associated with Cloudflare Workers. In this case, they originated from Cloudflare ASN (AS13335). The requests were highly distributed within those subnets, so it was impossible to identify specific IPs from which the attack originated.  
Additionally, the requests originated from multiple geographies, including the US, Australia and Ukraine, which made any type of geo-based blocking impossible.
The HTTPS GET Flood also used randomized URL parameters, so no two requests were identical. Also, the dynamic structure of the request meant it would not be cached by the customer’s CDN, but go directly to the web application’s origin server.
These parameters created multiple challenges that traditional DDoS mitigation methods couldn’t address.
Traditional Mitigation Methods Wouldn’t Have Been Sufficient
Apart from the novelty of using serverless scripts to generate the attack, the attack attributes made it particularly difficult to characterize. As a result, traditional DDoS mitigation approaches and tools would have been useless in this case.
Access Control Lists (ACLs) are useful when the attack is coming from a single source or a small number of known sources/IPs. In this case, however, the requests were widely distributed across large numbers of IPs, and across multiple IP ranges, of a large internet infrastructure. So, blocking those sources using fixed access control lists would not be possible due to the large number of sources. And because the traffic was coming through a large, well-known public infrastructure, blocking those IP addresses could have resulted in the blocking of legitimate traffic coming through those IPs or blocking legitimate services by using the Cloudflare Workers platform.
Geo-blocking would be problematic because the traffic originated from multiple countries (including the United States), so any type of geo-blocking would have been ineffective because it would have blocked out large portions of the world. And as a globally-distributed service provider, it wouldn’t work for the customer because it would block out large numbers of legitimate customers.
Rate limits are popular with some DDoS mitigation services as a means of limiting the number of requests — good or bad — reaching the application. A significant downside of this approach is that it does not distinguish between good and bad connections. This means that legitimate transactions are also blocked, leading to high rates of false positives. In a massive attack like this one, where malicious requests vastly outnumbered the number of legitimate connects, rate limiting would have prevented legitimate traffic from reaching the application. As a result, the attackers would have achieved their objective.
Fixed signatures/rules wouldn’t have stopped this attack because of the complex structure of the custom GET requests and the dynamic, randomized parameters that were used. So, pre-existing, static signatures would not have been enough to either identify the attack patterns or distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic.
This is exactly where Radware’s automated web DDoS mitigation technologies came into play and mitigated this attack.
Automation and Expertise Make the Difference
Radware successfully mitigated the attack using a combination of its automated DDoS protection algorithms with the expertise of Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) .
Once the traffic reached Radware’s network, the high volumes of requests were identified and characterized as malicious traffic and blocked, but the legitimate user traffic continued to the application, and with no interruptions.
Radware’s ERT experts then drilled down into the characteristics of the attack and the attributes of attack packets to identify common traits. Once that was done, custom signatures were put in place, which dropped all attack packets as they came into the Radware network, finally ending the attack.
Summary
To mitigate automated offensive cybersecurity activity, organizations must deploy defensive automation capabilities.
Radware provides protection against Web DDoS Tsunami attacks using behavioral-based detection and real-time signature creation, which adapts defense signatures to the specific parameters of the attack. This allows for creating attack signatures that are IP agnostic (i.e., they don’t rely on the origin of the attack traffic) and rapid adaption to changing attack patterns.
Radware’s automated Web DDoS protections are greatly augmented and enhanced by the expertise of Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT), one of the industry’s largest and most experienced security teams. Radware’s ERT staff work daily on DDoS and application attacks; they have tremendous experience dealing with sophisticated and unknown attacks.
Both were showcased over the course of this incident, as Radware successfully protected its customer against a massive, prolonged and complex DDoS attack.

How to Stop Disruptive Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks

The cyber security world is in turmoil. A new generation of HTTPS DDoS attacks is disrupting the market, bypassing organizations’ DDoS protection and WAF solutions. As we explained in our detailed threat analysis report, many of these attacks are launched by hacktivist groups — such as Killnet, NoName057(16), Team Insane PK, Mysterious Team, Passion Group and Anonymous Sudan — that are leveraging new, sophisticated botnets and tools to launch cyber terrorism and agenda-driven attacks around the world. In a period spanning just two months, from February 18 to April 18, 2023, over 1,800 DoS (denial-of-service) attacks were claimed by hacktivists across 80 Telegram channels. These attacks are high in RPS (Requests Per Second) and sophisticated in behavior, masquerading as legit traffic and going unnoticed upon decryption.
Network-based DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF) solutions, which have been effective in the past, are no longer capable of protecting against the new type of HTTP DDoS Tsunami Attacks. One of the challenges posed by the new type of HTTP DDoS flood attacks is their high RPS rates. Attackers can generate a vast number of requests per second, overwhelming web servers, load balancers and WAFs, and causing them to crash.
Many DDoS protection and WAF solutions rely on rate limiting to block such attacks, but the cost is very high because doing so means blocking legitimate traffic from accessing the application. Another factor that contributes to the ineffectiveness of standard DDoS protection and WAF solutions against new types of HTTP/S DDoS flood attacks is their reliance on pre-defined signatures. These solutions use signature-based detection, which relies on pre-defined patterns of known attacks. However, the new type of HTTPS DDoS flood attacks is designed to evade signature-based detection, rendering these solutions ineffective. Security teams need to spend hours and days analyzing the attack traffic in order to establish new rules, which by that time won’t be relevant as the attack will have already shifted to a new set of unknown HTTP requests. The attacking botnets are randomizing HTTPS methods, headers and cookies, impersonating popular embedded third-party services, spoofing IPs, and more. Among the application-level attack methods seen in these recent campaigns were HTTPS Get, Push and Post request attacks with changing parameters, behind proxies and dynamic IP attacks. All look like legitimate requests.
Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks in Real Life
Here are a couple of examples of web DDoS Tsunami Attacks the Radware Web DDoS Protection Solution automatically mitigated for one of our customers just last week.

Figures 1 and 2 – 738K RPS HTTPS DDoS attack

Figure 3 – 878K RPS HTTPS DDoS attack
The above images were taken last week just a few days apart on our Cloud Application Protection portal. The first attack lasted four hours and peaked at 880K RPS. Just a few days later a second attack occurred that lasted almost 2 hours and peaked at 738K RPS.
As you can see from the latest signatures that were generated immediately by the Web DDoS protection engine, these web DDoS Tsunami Attacks look like legit traffic with HTTP methods such as GET, DELETE and PUT, and have standard headers and structure.
Our solution was able to stop these two attacks from the get-go while still allowing all legitimate traffic in.
Radware To the Rescue
Radware has foreseen this future that is now a reality. So, to overcome this level of attack sophistication, our product teams developed and recently introduced proprietary, behavioral-based algorithms that can detect and quickly generate new signatures for unknown malicious requests at a high scale on the fly and, in real-time, mitigate these web DDoS Tsunami Attacks without generating false positives and blocking legitimate traffic.
Unlike other vendors that use a volumetric approach that doesn’t distinguish between good and bad traffic, Radware’s solution accurately distinguishes between legitimate traffic surges and malicious attack traffic. The solution protects against a wide range of Level 7 (L7) DDoS threats, including sophisticated attacks, new L7 attack tools and large-scale Web DDoS Tsunami Attacks. It continuously and automatically analyzes various threats and their numerous variants, adapting to any attack patterns and randomization methods.

Make Sure You Have These Analysis Tools That Are in Radware’s DDoS Management Solution

One of the most commonly overlooked topics when selecting a DDoS protection solution relates to analytics and reporting tools. Many customers choose a DDoS solution based solely on either how effective they believe it will be or how well they’ve been told it protects against various attacks. However, customers often overlook the importance of critical tools, including real-time analytics, dashboards, reporting capabilities and others related to analysis and monitoring.
The following are common, day-to-day use cases and the tools you’ll need to address them.
First, You’ll Need the Right Dashboard
The first tool that is critical is that single, pane-of-glass dashboard. It provides overall, real-time visibility and different points of view, including:
The current state of your network:
oAre you under attack? What are the current attacks?
oWhat are current and recent changes to your network?
oWhich traffic is legitimate and what has been dropped due to an attack?
oHow can I get real-time statistics to help me learn about the current state of our network, such as concurrent connections, connection rates, traffic composition, and more.
  The ability to drill down into a specific attack and analyze related properties, including:
Attack category(ies), volume (bps/pbps), maximum traffic, dropped traffic, top sources, and more.
A dynamic screen that provides visibility widgets and statistics based on the specific attack categories needing analysis.
The ability to analyze the attack throughout its lifecycle and learn how it has evolved and is being mitigated.
oThe ability to dynamically change the scope being analyzed based on user-defined changes to the dashboard. Here are two examples:
Changing the timeframe within the dashboard.
Reviewing changes in the scope of the network being analyzed.
oTop attacks by different criteria, including top sources, destinations, attacking geolocations, attacks by volume, attack categories, scanners, and more.
oA dedicated dashboard for analysis of IP reputation feeds and behavioral attacks by type.
o
Here are Two Very Common Scenarios In Which You May Find Yourself
Scenario 1
Imagine an IT manager calls you and is concerned because customers are reporting that applications under attack are suffering from performance degradation.
How can you analyze and verify whether the concern is valid? Also, how can you provide answers, and fast?
Here’s what you’ll need:
First, you need a tool that enables you to analyze your attack database in (recent) minutes, hours, days, weeks, even months. This can require various, often complex, criteria, which can make it difficult to find answers. It’s similar to a forensics tool used at a crime scene.
Second, you need to find answers. This is an example of a very common analysis used to find them. Define a new query in which “Destination IP” equals the server hosting the application. The query results will identify several application attacks during the time frame you’ve selected and from the same attack source.
Now, you may ask yourself whether additional applications are being attacked by the same attack source. You can answer your own question; just update the query to include the source IP to help determine additional applications that may be under attack.
Again, this scenario is very common; in fact, it’s been brought to my attention many times over the years by IT professionals like yourself. In short, you need additional capabilities to address more complex analyses. For instance, you may need to analyze an attack lifecycle, identify mitigation throughout the lifecycle and learn about the impact of dropped traffic.
Scenario 2
Imagine you’re out of the office and unable to view your DDoS management console. However, you want to be notified in real time when a user-defined attack occurs in your network. Of course, you always want to remain on top of things and be the first to know if there are any occurrences.
Here’s what you’ll need:
You need an alerting tool or engine with the ability to define rules based on multiple and flexible criteria that will instruct your DDoS management system to alert you via email.
Of course, you’ll be able to receive and read the email(s) from your mobile phone anywhere and at any time. And if needed, you’ll be able to open your laptop and begin handling the event.
Here’s an example of a rule you may need to define:
You will want required alert(s) to notify you each time an attack in a particular category occurs. In this example, we’ll define that category as “Behavioral DoS” and set the alert to occur when it is greater than 100Mbps.
Now you can define the alert and a rule that consists of two criteria — one for an attack category attribute AND a second for rate/bps that is greater than operator-set criteria. Please note, the “AND” is emphasized in ALL CAPS to denote that it is only when both criteria are met that the alert is generated. You can now customize the message and indicate how frequently it should be sent. Now, simply save it.
Once an attack meeting your definition is ongoing and on your network, you’ll be notified immediately. Now you are in control.
Here are reporting scenarios in which you’ll get to:
oGenerate reports to assist you in identifying trends.
oReport to management at the end of each week the statistics related to last week’s traffic trends and attacks.
oExtract information that will enable you to achieve the above, and more.
oGain the same visibility and information you get from your dashboards, including additional information, breakdowns and details.
oGenerate a managerial PDF report in which you can add free-form observations. This can easily serve as the report’s executive summary.
oGenerate report graphs only (excluding detailed tables, if desired) to be used when sharing with, or presenting to, management.  
oPull flexible, user-friendly reports you define that will successfully address your specific needs. As an example, you may want to define a report with the same graphics and visibility, but split them into different sections within the report. For example, one section can include statistics for one region and another section for a different one. Both will be included in a single report.  
oGenerate reports in a variety of formats, including PDF, HTML and CSV. Each format may be needed to serve different purposes. For example, a CSV report can be highly detailed and used to generate your own graphs in Excel.
oSchedule the generation of automated reports that you can easily share with others.
Summary
To properly handle these scenarios — and an array of others — you must ensure your DDoS management solution includes tools similar to the ones mentioned. To find a solution that includes them, you don’t have to go far. Radware has developed and deployed these and many other tools based on years of interactions with and feedback from thousands of customers large and small and from every industry.

  The ability to drill down into a specific attack and analyze related properties, including:
Attack category(ies), volume (bps/pbps), maximum traffic, dropped traffic, top sources, and more.
A dynamic screen that provides visibility widgets and statistics based on the specific attack categories needing analysis.
The ability to analyze the attack throughout its lifecycle and learn how it has evolved and is being mitigated.
The ability to dynamically change the scope being analyzed based on user-defined changes to the dashboard. Here are two examples:
oChanging the timeframe within the dashboard.
oReviewing changes in the scope of the network being analyzed.
Top attacks by different criteria, including top sources, destinations, attacking geolocations, attacks by volume, attack categories, scanners, and more.
A dedicated dashboard for analysis of IP reputation feeds and behavioral attacks by type.

Here are Two Very Common Scenarios In Which You May Find Yourself
Scenario 1
Imagine an IT manager calls you and is concerned because customers are reporting that applications under attack are suffering from performance degradation.
How can you analyze and verify whether the concern is valid? Also, how can you provide answers, and fast?
Here’s what you’ll need:
First, you need a tool that enables you to analyze your attack database in (recent) minutes, hours, days, weeks, even months. This can require various, often complex, criteria, which can make it difficult to find answers. It’s similar to a forensics tool used at a crime scene.
Second, you need to find answers. This is an example of a very common analysis used to find them. Define a new query in which “Destination IP” equals the server hosting the application. The query results will identify several application attacks during the time frame you’ve selected and from the same attack source.
Now, you may ask yourself whether additional applications are being attacked by the same attack source. You can answer your own question; just update the query to include the source IP to help determine additional applications that may be under attack.
Again, this scenario is very common; in fact, it’s been brought to my attention many times over the years by IT professionals like yourself. In short, you need additional capabilities to address more complex analyses. For instance, you may need to analyze an attack lifecycle, identify mitigation throughout the lifecycle and learn about the impact of dropped traffic.
Scenario 2
Imagine you’re out of the office and unable to view your DDoS management console. However, you want to be notified in real time when a user-defined attack occurs in your network. Of course, you always want to remain on top of things and be the first to know if there are any occurrences.
Here’s what you’ll need:
You need an alerting tool or engine with the ability to define rules based on multiple and flexible criteria that will instruct your DDoS management system to alert you via email.
Of course, you’ll be able to receive and read the email(s) from your mobile phone anywhere and at any time. And if needed, you’ll be able to open your laptop and begin handling the event.
Here’s an example of a rule you may need to define:
You will want required alert(s) to notify you each time an attack in a particular category occurs. In this example, we’ll define that category as “Behavioral DoS” and set the alert to occur when it is greater than 100Mbps.

Imagine you’re out of the office and unable to view your DDoS management console. However, you want to be notified in real time when a user-defined attack occurs in your network. Of course, you always want to remain on top of things and be the first to know if there are any occurrences.
Here’s what you’ll need:
You need an alerting tool or engine with the ability to define rules based on multiple and flexible criteria that will instruct your DDoS management system to alert you via email.
Of course, you’ll be able to receive and read the email(s) from your mobile phone anywhere and at any time. And if needed, you’ll be able to open your laptop and begin handling the event.
Here’s an example of a rule you may need to define:
You will want required alert(s) to notify you each time an attack in a particular category occurs. In this example, we’ll define that category as “Behavioral DoS” and set the alert to occur when it is greater than 100Mbps.
Now you can define the alert and a rule that consists of two criteria — one for an attack category attribute AND a second for rate/bps that is greater than operator-set criteria. Please note, the “AND” is emphasized in ALL CAPS to denote that it is only when both criteria are met that the alert is generated. You can now customize the message and indicate how frequently it should be sent. Now, simply save it.
Once an attack meeting your definition is ongoing and on your network, you’ll be notified immediately. Now you are in control.
Here are reporting scenarios in which you’ll get to:
Generate reports to assist you in identifying trends.
Report to management at the end of each week the statistics related to last week’s traffic trends and attacks.
Extract information that will enable you to achieve the above, and more.
Gain the same visibility and information you get from your dashboards, including additional information, breakdowns and details.
Generate a managerial PDF report in which you can add free-form observations. This can easily serve as the report’s executive summary.
Generate report graphs only (excluding detailed tables, if desired) to be used when sharing with, or presenting to, management.  
Pull flexible, user-friendly reports you define that will successfully address your specific needs. As an example, you may want to define a report with the same graphics and visibility, but split them into different sections within the report. For example, one section can include statistics for one region and another section for a different one. Both will be included in a single report.  
Generate reports in a variety of formats, including PDF, HTML and CSV. Each format may be needed to serve different purposes. For example, a CSV report can be highly detailed and used to generate your own graphs in Excel.
Schedule the generation of automated reports that you can easily share with others.
Summary
To properly handle these scenarios — and an array of others — you must ensure your DDoS management solution includes tools similar to the ones mentioned. To find a solution that includes them, you don’t have to go far. Radware has developed and deployed these and many other tools based on years of interactions with and feedback from thousands of customers large and small and from every industry.

The ability to drill down into a specific attack and analyze related properties, including:
Attack category(ies), volume (bps/pbps), maximum traffic, dropped traffic, top sources, and more.
A dynamic screen that provides visibility widgets and statistics based on the specific attack categories needing analysis.
The ability to analyze the attack throughout its lifecycle and learn how it has evolved and is being mitigated.
The ability to dynamically change the scope being analyzed based on user-defined changes to the dashboard. Here are two examples:
Changing the timeframe within the dashboard.
Reviewing changes in the scope of the network being analyzed.
Top attacks by different criteria, including top sources, destinations, attacking geolocations, attacks by volume, attack categories, scanners, and more.
A dedicated dashboard for analysis of IP reputation feeds and behavioral attacks by type.

Here are Two Very Common Scenarios In Which You May Find Yourself
Scenario 1
Imagine an IT manager calls you and is concerned because customers are reporting that applications under attack are suffering from performance degradation.
How can you analyze and verify whether the concern is valid? Also, how can you provide answers, and fast?
Here’s what you’ll need:
First, you need a tool that enables you to analyze your attack database in (recent) minutes, hours, days, weeks, even months. This can require various, often complex, criteria, which can make it difficult to find answers. It’s similar to a forensics tool used at a crime scene.
Second, you need to find answers. This is an example of a very common analysis used to find them. Define a new query in which “Destination IP” equals the server hosting the application. The query results will identify several application attacks during the time frame you’ve selected and from the same attack source.
Now, you may ask yourself whether additional applications are being attacked by the same attack source. You can answer your own question; just update the query to include the source IP to help determine additional applications that may be under attack.
Again, this scenario is very common; in fact, it’s been brought to my attention many times over the years by IT professionals like yourself. In short, you need additional capabilities to address more complex analyses. For instance, you may need to analyze an attack lifecycle, identify mitigation throughout the lifecycle and learn about the impact of dropped traffic.

The query results will identify several application attacks during the time frame you’ve selected and from the same attack source.
Now, you may ask yourself whether additional applications are being attacked by the same attack source. You can answer your own question; just update the query to include the source IP to help determine additional applications that may be under attack.
Again, this scenario is very common; in fact, it’s been brought to my attention many times over the years by IT professionals like yourself. In short, you need additional capabilities to address more complex analyses. For instance, you may need to analyze an attack lifecycle, identify mitigation throughout the lifecycle and learn about the impact of dropped traffic.
Scenario 2
Imagine you’re out of the office and unable to view your DDoS management console. However, you want to be notified in real time when a user-defined attack occurs in your network. Of course, you always want to remain on top of things and be the first to know if there are any occurrences.
Here’s what you’ll need:
You need an alerting tool or engine with the ability to define rules based on multiple and flexible criteria that will instruct your DDoS management system to alert you via email.
Of course, you’ll be able to receive and read the email(s) from your mobile phone anywhere and at any time. And if needed, you’ll be able to open your laptop and begin handling the event.
Here’s an example of a rule you may need to define:
You will want required alert(s) to notify you each time an attack in a particular category occurs. In this example, we’ll define that category as “Behavioral DoS” and set the alert to occur when it is greater than 100Mbps.
Now you can define the alert and a rule that consists of two criteria — one for an attack category attribute AND a second for rate/bps that is greater than operator-set criteria. Please note, the “AND” is emphasized in ALL CAPS to denote that it is only when both criteria are met that the alert is generated. You can now customize the message and indicate how frequently it should be sent. Now, simply save it.
Once an attack meeting your definition is ongoing and on your network, you’ll be notified immediately. Now you are in control.
Here are reporting scenarios in which you’ll get to:
Generate reports to assist you in identifying trends.
Report to management at the end of each week the statistics related to last week’s traffic trends and attacks.
Extract information that will enable you to achieve the above, and more.
Gain the same visibility and information you get from your dashboards, including additional information, breakdowns and details.
Generate a managerial PDF report in which you can add free-form observations. This can easily serve as the report’s executive summary.
Generate report graphs only (excluding detailed tables, if desired) to be used when sharing with, or presenting to, management.  
Pull flexible, user-friendly reports you define that will successfully address your specific needs. As an example, you may want to define a report with the same graphics and visibility, but split them into different sections within the report. For example, one section can include statistics for one region and another section for a different one. Both will be included in a single report.  
Generate reports in a variety of formats, including PDF, HTML and CSV. Each format may be needed to serve different purposes. For example, a CSV report can be highly detailed and used to generate your own graphs in Excel.
Schedule the generation of automated reports that you can easily share with others.
Summary
To properly handle these scenarios — and an array of others — you must ensure your DDoS management solution includes tools similar to the ones mentioned. To find a solution that includes them, you don’t have to go far. Radware has developed and deployed these and many other tools based on years of interactions with and feedback from thousands of customers large and small and from every industry.

Here are Two Very Common Scenarios In Which You May Find Yourself
Scenario 1

Here are Two Very Common Scenarios In Which You May Find Yourself
Scenario 1
Imagine an IT manager calls you and is concerned because customers are reporting that applications under attack are suffering from performance degradation.
How can you analyze and verify whether the concern is valid? Also, how can you provide answers, and fast?
Here’s what you’ll need:
First, you need a tool that enables you to analyze your attack database in (recent) minutes, hours, days, weeks, even months. This can require various, often complex, criteria, which can make it difficult to find answers. It’s similar to a forensics tool used at a crime scene.
Second, you need to find answers. This is an example of a very common analysis used to find them. Define a new query in which “Destination IP” equals the server hosting the application. The query results will identify several application attacks during the time frame you’ve selected and from the same attack source.
Now, you may ask yourself whether additional applications are being attacked by the same attack source. You can answer your own question; just update the query to include the source IP to help determine additional applications that may be under attack.
Again, this scenario is very common; in fact, it’s been brought to my attention many times over the years by IT professionals like yourself. In short, you need additional capabilities to address more complex analyses. For instance, you may need to analyze an attack lifecycle, identify mitigation throughout the lifecycle and learn about the impact of dropped traffic.
Scenario 2
Imagine you’re out of the office and unable to view your DDoS management console. However, you want to be notified in real time when a user-defined attack occurs in your network. Of course, you always want to remain on top of things and be the first to know if there are any occurrences.
Here’s what you’ll need:
You need an alerting tool or engine with the ability to define rules based on multiple and flexible criteria that will instruct your DDoS management system to alert you via email.
Of course, you’ll be able to receive and read the email(s) from your mobile phone anywhere and at any time. And if needed, you’ll be able to open your laptop and begin handling the event.
Here’s an example of a rule you may need to define:
You will want required alert(s) to notify you each time an attack in a particular category occurs. In this example, we’ll define that category as “Behavioral DoS” and set the alert to occur when it is greater than 100Mbps.
Now you can define the alert and a rule that consists of two criteria — one for an attack category attribute AND a second for rate/bps that is greater than operator-set criteria. Please note, the “AND” is emphasized in ALL CAPS to denote that it is only when both criteria are met that the alert is generated. You can now customize the message and indicate how frequently it should be sent. Now, simply save it.
Once an attack meeting your definition is ongoing and on your network, you’ll be notified immediately. Now you are in control.
Here are reporting scenarios in which you’ll get to:
Generate reports to assist you in identifying trends.
Report to management at the end of each week the statistics related to last week’s traffic trends and attacks.
Extract information that will enable you to achieve the above, and more.
Gain the same visibility and information you get from your dashboards, including additional information, breakdowns and details.
Generate a managerial PDF report in which you can add free-form observations. This can easily serve as the report’s executive summary.
Generate report graphs only (excluding detailed tables, if desired) to be used when sharing with, or presenting to, management.  
Pull flexible, user-friendly reports you define that will successfully address your specific needs. As an example, you may want to define a report with the same graphics and visibility, but split them into different sections within the report. For example, one section can include statistics for one region and another section for a different one. Both will be included in a single report.  
Generate reports in a variety of formats, including PDF, HTML and CSV. Each format may be needed to serve different purposes. For example, a CSV report can be highly detailed and used to generate your own graphs in Excel.
Schedule the generation of automated reports that you can easily share with others.

What Are HTTP Floods? Oh, And They’re On The Rise — Part 1

In case you haven’t heard, HTTP Floods are on the rise, which may beg this question — what is an HTTP Flood? HTTP Floods are a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that occurs at Layer 7 of the OSI stack, which may beg this question — what is Layer 7 of the OSI stack? We’ll answer both questions, so keep reading. In another few minutes you’ll get all the answers, including why HTTP Floods are especially virulent and what you can do to protect your organization from them.
As a point of clarity, references to HTTP herein also apply to HTTPS. Over 99% of internet traffic is HTTPS; the S stands for secure, which means it’s encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS).
A Quick Refresher on the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Layers
In the early 1980’s, a decade before we happily surfed the internet and prepared to purchase our first cell phone (the 3-pound brick), computer manufacturers and telecom companies got together to determine how their equipment, applications and respective technologies could work together. It was a brilliant and prescient move. They came up with 7 communication layers, each one building on top of the previous layers. They called it the OSI model, and it was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (IOS) in 1984.
The initial, or bottom, layer is the physical layer. It is Layer 1 and covers the transmission and reception of raw data over physical media. It determines how bits of data are sent and represented so they can be properly and accurately converted on the receiving end. The top, or last, layer is the application layer. It’s Layer 7 and is the closest layer to the end user. It’s how we interact with a network or application. As an example, applications connected to the internet operate at Layer 7. And what operates at this layer? The HTTP protocol. 
(For point of reference, layers 1 through 7 are: physical, data, network, transport, session, presentation and application.)
Why is Layer 7 The New DDoS Target?
Most DDoS attacks have targeted layers 3 and 4, the network and transport layers. Many refer to these as infrastructure attacks. They are large and loud attacks and attempt to overload a network’s capacity. Detection is doable, but not easy. Now, attacks targeting Layer 7 are on the rise, which is why it’s so important to protect against them.
As an FYI, HTTP Floods are nothing new. They’ve been known about — at least in technology circles — for several years. But in the past several months, a massive amount of them have been reported by many AppSec cloud vendors, global public cloud providers (AWS, GCP) and others.
HTTP Flood attacks are more sophisticated and aggressive than traditional DDoS attacks of the past. To call them a headache for security teams and leaders is a gross understatement. Here’s why — in the attacks, a large number of legitimate-looking HTTP requests are sent to victims’ servers, overwhelming and exhausting resources. At the onset of an HTTP Flood attack, the victim’s server allocates the maximum possible amount of resources it has to accommodate the requests. It then begins to drop legitimate requests, ultimately becoming unresponsive.
What makes HTTP Floods especially harmful is that they’re hard to detect and differentiate from legitimate traffic. They are standard URL requests. And because they are lower bandwidth attacks — as opposed to volumetric attacks — they fly under the radar more easily. That is, until it’s finally revealed just how much damage they have done. In June of this year, an organization was hit with an HTTP Flood that resulted in over 45 million requests. For comparison purposes, it was the equivalent of Wikipedia’s daily requests…occurring in less than 10 seconds. A server doesn’t exist that can handle that.
Next month, we’ll go into several of the most noteworthy HTTP Flood attacks that have taken place over the past year. In addition, we’ll discuss attack durations, patterns detected, botnet usage, and more.

Cisco adds Cloud DDoS Protection to Enterprise Agreement, Expanding Strategic Partnership with Radware

With distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks continually increasing in frequency and complexity, organizations must ensure the resilience and availability of their networks and applications to enable business productivity, protect online revenues and meet SLAs for uptime.
Secure Cloud DDoS Protection Now Available on Cisco Enterprise Agreement
Radware and Cisco have expanded their partnership with an announcement that is good news for Cisco’s customers and bad news for DDoS threat actors. Cisco, the worldwide leader in technology that powers the internet, has added Cisco® Secure Cloud DDoS Protection, powered by Radware, to the Cisco Enterprise Agreement (EA). The addition of cloud DDoS protection to the EA simplifies the purchasing and licensing of Secure Cloud DDoS Protection for Cisco customers. For more information about Secure Cloud DDoS Protection, see www.cisco.com/go/secure-ddos.  
Effective DDoS Protection for An Evolving Threat Landscape
Modern DDoS attacks are sophisticated and damaging, often using multi-vector attacks, encrypted attacks and IoT botnets to target network and application resources with devastating DDoS floods. Additionally, we’ve entered the era of terabit, volumetric flood attacks that can exceed 2Tbps, which is more than enough traffic to overwhelm any unprotected network. Given the risks posed by today’s DDoS attacks, organizations must ensure that they have best-in-class DDoS protection to maintain service availability under attack.
Deployment Options for Every Customer Need
Cisco Secure DDoS Protection is a portfolio of DDoS protection solutions that offers deployment options to meet the needs and budget of every customer.
On-premises DDoS protection provides real-time, adaptive attack protection. On-premise DDoS protection is available either as an appliance or integrated with Cisco Secure Firewall 4100 and 9300 series.

Simplifying DDoS Protection in Large Service Provider Networks
Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to service providers; they have the potential to bring down critical infrastructure and disrupt business operations. In today’s digital age, protecting against DDoS attacks is no longer a luxury. It’s a necessity.
However, implementing and managing effective DDoS protection solutions can be complex and costly, particularly for large service providers.
In the following, we will explore how to simplify DDoS protection for the networks of large service providers. I’ll discuss the challenges facing them and provide practical solutions to mitigate the risks of DDoS attacks.
The Challenges Of Protecting A Large Service Provider Network
Scale: Service providers typically operate large networks with multiple entry points. This makes it a challenge to identify and mitigate DDoS attacks across the entire infrastructure.
Complexity: DDoS attacks can come in various forms, and different types of attacks require different mitigation techniques. As a result, implementing effective DDoS protection requires specialized expertise and knowledge.
Cost: DDoS protection solutions can be expensive, and the cost of implementing and managing these solutions can add up quickly, particularly for service providers operating large networks.
Time-sensitive: DDoS attacks can happen at any time and without warning. So, service providers need to have fast response times to mitigate the attack before it causes significant damage.
Collaboration: Service providers often need to collaborate with other organizations — including upstream providers, peers and customers — to implement effective DDoS protection solutions. However, ensuring that everyone is on the same page and working towards a common goal can be challenging.
5 Strategies for Simplifying DDoS Protection for Service Provider Networks:
1. Implement a dedicated DDoS protection solution. One of the most effective ways to simplify DDoS protection is to implement a dedicated DDoS protection solution. This can help centralize DDoS mitigation and streamline the process of detecting and blocking DDoS attacks. Look for solutions that can be integrated into your existing network infrastructure and offer real-time monitoring and reporting to quickly identify and mitigate attacks. Non-dedicated DDoS solutions often have limited visibility into the network and may not be able to detect all types of DDoS attacks. In addition, it may produce false positives that can result in legitimate traffic being blocked.
2. Use behavioral protections instead of rate-limiting. Behavioral DDoS protection solutions can accurately distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic. This is because they analyze the behavior of the traffic, rather than just the rate or volume. By doing so, they can identify and block attacks that may bypass rate-limiting protections. Behavioral DDoS protection is more scalable than rate-limiting because it does not place hard limits on the number of connections or packets per second. Instead, it can adapt dynamically to traffic patterns and adjust the thresholds based on the observed behavior. Behavioral DDoS protection can reduce false positives by analyzing traffic behavior and identifying legitimate traffic patterns, even if they exceed predefined rate limits.
3. Use BGP Flowspec. BGP Flowspec is a protocol that enables service providers to block DDoS traffic at the network edge using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This can help prevent DDoS traffic from entering your network and affecting your customers. Look for vendors that offer BGP Flowspec support to simplify the process of configuring and managing this feature. BGP Flowspec enables service providers to filter traffic based on specific criteria, such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol type or port number. This granular filtering capability allows service providers to target only the traffic that is part of the DDoS attack and block it while allowing legitimate traffic to continue to flow. BGP Flowspec is a cost-effective solution for DDoS protection because it uses existing network infrastructure and does not require additional hardware or software. This can significantly reduce the cost of implementing and managing DDoS protection solutions.
4. Use cloud DDoS protection services. Another option is to use cloud scrubbing services provided by a 3rd party vendor. These services can help offload the burden of DDoS protection from your internal teams and provide an additional layer of defense. Look for vendors that offer scrubbing centers that are geographically distributed; this can help minimize the impact of attacks on your network.
5. Automate DDoS protection. Finally, consider implementing automation to streamline the process of detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. This can help reduce the workload on your internal teams and ensure that attacks are detected and mitigated quickly. DDoS attacks can be complex and come from multiple sources. This makes it difficult for human analysts to identify the attack vectors and take appropriate action. Look for solutions that offer automation features, such as auto-scaling, auto-remediation and auto-configuration.
Here’s the Best Solution
Radware’s Cyber Controller is simply the best service provider network security toolbox on the market. It allows service providers to create and manage a complete DDoS attack life-cycle orchestration using the following key capabilities:
Automation. You can automate many of the tasks involved in DDoS protection, such as alert triage, incident response and mitigation. This enables service providers to respond quickly and effectively to DDoS attacks. It reduces the risk of downtime and minimizes the impact on customers.
Integration. With Cyber Controller, you can integrate with a wide range of security tools, including DDoS protection solutions, network security devices and threat intelligence feeds. This integration enables service providers to orchestrate a unified response to DDoS attacks and leverage the strengths of different security tools to achieve better protection.
Centralization. You’ll enjoy a centralized platform for managing DDoS protection across the entire network infrastructure. This centralized view enables service providers to monitor the network in real time, identify potential threats and take appropriate action to mitigate them.
Customizations. Radware customers benefit from flexibility in configuring DDoS protection policies based on their specific needs. These solutions can be customized to suit the unique requirements of large service provider networks, such as differentiating between inbound and outbound traffic and applying different mitigation strategies based on the type and severity of the attack.
Cloud Overflow Protection. Radware’s unique, hybrid DDoS protection with both on-prem DDoS protection and cloud DDoS protection services allows service providers complete protection with a smaller on-prem footprint and a flexible way to grow and protect against ever-growing DDoS attacks.

5 Things to Consider if You Need Ongoing DDoS Protection
Here are the first things that come to mind when many people think of a DDoS attack: Unsophisticated, the oldest trick in the book, not harmful, “I am not at risk”, and on and on. I am here to tell you it is all false. Our current DDoS threat landscape proves it. Although we see many attacks in the news that are related to political debates and extremists’ hacktivism, other targets, including high schools, e-commerce, and others, don’t necessarily make the news but are attacked as regularly. What we know now is that everybody is a target, and many attacks are getting so sophisticated that they cannot be stopped by conventional DDoS mitigation methods.
So, as promised, here is a list of 5 things every organization should seriously consider to ensure its full and ongoing protection against DDoS threats out there.
1. End-to-End Protection
DDoS protection doesn’t stop at installing a DDoS mitigation solution, whether it is on-prem, in the cloud or a hybrid of both. There is so much more that needs to be thought of ahead of time to make sure a network is safe from a DDoS attack. First, third parties, such as DNS services, that have access to the network must be considered. They have the potential of going down and making your services unavailable. Second, threat intelligence is needed to properly prepare preemptive protections. Knowing ahead of time about known attacks and attackers is critical in the mitigation of major DDoS threats. Third, the service is critical. Having a great protection solution is great, but not having experts by your side when you need them spells trouble. Make sure you have the best SLA (service level agreement) commitment to ensure you have access to everything you need when under attack. Fourth, and last, is scalability. DDoS attacks increase in volume every year and protections need to evolve accordingly. Having the option to scale up or down based on the attack can make the difference between good protection and the right protection.
2. Peacetime Learning
DDoS protection is a lot like car insurance. You invest in it but hope to never use it. Unfortunately, if you are not ready with the right insurance when you are in a massive accident, that is when the “ I wish I would have known better” thinking starts. Let’s not wait for that. In the cyber security world, there is what we call peacetime. It defines the periods of time when no attacks occur. What is highly underestimated is the importance of peacetime. Most people see it as a time when they’ve wasted a lot of money protecting against attacks that never came. Due to budget cuts, some cancel protection after a long period of peacetime. What these people don’t understand is that peacetime learning is worth gold when it comes to adapting the protections and perfecting them for doomsday. In peacetime, a network can be constantly evaluated and patterns identified to profile the behavior of legitimate network traffic. These learning capabilities make it a lot easier to provide accurate protection from advanced attacks when they come.
3. Behavioral-Based Protection
The term behavioral-based protection is getting a lot of traction in the DDoS protection scene. More and more vendors claim to have it, or even excel in it. But what is it and why do you need it? Well, as much as people complicate the term, I’ll make it simple. At the end of the day, the main thing this should mean is  What happens to your legitimate users when under attack? Behavioral-based protection should be there to make sure you have a minimum number of false positives and that legitimate users trying to access your services can do so, even while you are under attack. But let’s face it, just making sure they have access is not enough. You have to ensure you preserve the entire user experience for them. They absolutely should not care about the fact that you are under attack. They just want to be serviced properly. They pay a substantial amount of money for business continuity; if you cannot provide that, they will move on to the next person, or company, that can.
4. Application Protection
One of the biggest misconceptions about DDoS attacks is that they occur only at the network level. Today, we see record-breaking DDoS attacks in the application layer, as well. To think that the protections required are reserved for the network layer is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. Attackers are well aware of this misconception among network managers. That’s why, in many cases, it becomes their weapon of choice. The real challenge in application or L7 (layer 7) DDoS attacks is that the traffic at first seems like legitimate traffic. Only when the website is overwhelmed with traffic and cannot service clients properly is there an understanding that an attack has begun. And by that time, it is far too late. While these attacks are highly dangerous, there is still not enough awareness of the threat and not enough protections available that will protect an application when under a DDoS attack.
5. Consistency Across All Environments
Network topologies are rarely only on-prem or just in the cloud. In most cases, today’s architectures are comprised of several different components that all need to be protected from DDoS attacks. Finding one protection that can be deployed across all environments is crucial for the network to stay protected at all times. However, that isn’t the only concern. After achieving that, the next step is to make sure consistency of mitigation can be maintained across each and every one of the deployments, whether it is on-prem, in a private cloud or in any of the public cloud platforms available. Nobody wants to deal with several vendors to get full protection. Or, even worse, to have to settle on protection that doesn’t provide the needed full coverage because that is all they could find. Let’s not forget that each solution and vendor come with their own infrastructures, management systems and maintenance. Having the option to gain full visibility in one place and into all aspects of the network, no matter what the deployment is and where it has been deployed, delivers great advantages.
DDoS Protection — Not a Set-It-and-Forget-It Proposition
DDoS attacks continue to evolve, which is why it is critical to deploy a DDoS protection solution that advances and grows, as well. It’s definitely not a set-it-and-forget-it proposition. You need to deploy solutions that provide ongoing protection, whether in peacetime or during an attack. What you need is the best; what you need is Radware.

The Power of 2: Why 2-Tier DDoS Protection is Critical for Your Business
A 2-tier DDoS solution combining on-premises and cloud-based protection is the best practice recommended by industry experts, including Gartner. By utilizing both solutions, organizations can benefit from the strengths of each, including the ability to mitigate attacks closer to the source with on-premises protection and the scalability and flexibility of cloud-based protection. This approach provides a comprehensive and effective defense against DDoS attacks; it reduces the risk of downtime and damage to the organization’s reputation.
As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it is important for organizations to adopt best practices like a 2-tier DDoS solution to stay ahead of attackers and ensure the continuity of their operations.
The Unstoppable Rise of DDoS Attacks
Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have been a common and growing threat for many years and cause significant disruption to organizations. In 2022, DDoS attacks continued to be a major issue. The cyber landscape was marked by a sharp increase in malicious activities and DDoS attacks, particularly targeting organizations in the financial, healthcare and technology sectors.
Here’s proof: Radware’s Cloud DDoS Service recorded a 233% growth in blocked malicious events compared to the previous year, which saw the number of DDoS attacks grow by 150%. The total attack volume reached 4.44PBps, a 32% increase from 2021. The largest recorded attack in 2022 was 1.46TBps, a staggering 2.8 times larger than the largest attack recorded in 2021.
The frequency of attacks also saw a significant uptick, with organizations mitigating an average of 29.3 attacks per day in Q4 of 2022. This was a 3.5 times increase compared to the previous year.

Attacks not only grew in number, but also in complexity and sophistication. With the new norm of DDoS peaks at 300-500Gbps directed towards governments, critical infrastructure and SaaS verticals, DDoS attacks included over twenty different vectors, including, but not limited to, UDP, TCP, ICMP, SYN, DNS, known server vulnerabilities, handshake violations, randomized floods, and more.

In an ever-growing DDoS threat landscape, you must make sure your protection is future-proof, complete and zero-day ready. A recommended practice for DDoS mitigation is a 2-tier solution; it allows customers full control and optimal security coverage for DDoS.  
What is a 2-tier DDoS Solution?
A 2-tier DDoS solution is a hybrid architecture that combines both cloud-based protection and on-premises protection to create a comprehensive defense against DDoS attacks. The cloud-based protection is designed to handle large-scale volumetric attacks, while on-premises protection provides defense against targeted attacks or application-layer attacks that require more granular inspection.
What are the benefits of a 2-tier DDoS solution?
Improved Resiliency: A 2-tier DDoS solution provides greater resiliency by distributing the load between two different layers of protection. If one layer is compromised or overwhelmed, the other layer continues to provide protection.
Enhanced Visibility: On-premises protection provides greater visibility into network traffic, allowing for more granular inspection of traffic patterns and the ability to identify and block suspicious activity more quickly.
Cost-Effective: Cloud-based protection can be more cost-effective for large volumetric attacks, while on-premises protection can be more cost-effective for smaller, application-layer attacks.
Compliance: Many organizations must comply with data privacy regulations, which can limit the use of cloud-based solutions. A 2-tier DDoS solution allows for greater flexibility to meet compliance requirements.
Customization: A 2-tier DDoS solution can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization, providing a more tailored approach to DDoS protection.
What are the key values of on-prem DDoS protection and why you need it?
Detection Accuracy: On-premises protection optimizes detection accuracy due to outgoing traffic visibility. Correlating outgoing with incoming traffic allows for accurate distinction between good and bad traffic, which means more accurate mitigation of DDoS attacks.
Outgoing threats: On-premises protection helps protect organizations from internal threats, data leakages and reputation risks due to network abuse. This is done by denying malicious, outgoing traffic of bots, malware, C&C, and more.
Low latency: On-premises protection can provide lower latency for critical applications; even a small delay here can cause significant problems.
Data Privacy: As mentioned earlier, data privacy regulations may limit the use of cloud-based solutions, making on-premises protection a better option for organizations with these requirements.
Align Your DDoS Solution to a Best Practice
Don’t allow blind spots in your security posture. Make sure you have full visibility and control, and complete security coverage and data privacy with on-premises protection. A behavioral security solution helps you automate your security policy and optimize your ongoing costs. Add cloud-based protection for large volumetric smoke screen attacks that risk your data by hiding targeted attacks that can be blocked by your on-premises protection.

Terabit DDoS Attacks Need State-of-the-Art Terabit DDoS Mitigation — Are you ready?
In recent years, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have become more frequent and sophisticated. Attackers continue to find new ways to flood target networks with massive-scale attacks that grow exponentially and cross the terabit attack rate. This has become a major concern for enterprises and carriers worldwide and Radware is the only vendor holding the on-prem mitigation answers to these massive attacks.
The impact of these hyper volumetric DDoS attacks can be devastating — they cause extended downtime, financial losses and reputational damage. That’s why it’s critical that organizations are prepared to detect and mitigate these vicious attacks with a state-of-the-art mitigation on-prem platform.
3 Reasons Why You Need an Ultra-High-End Mitigation Platform
1. The Terabit DDoS Attack Era Is Here
In the world of cybersecurity, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and damaging. One of the emerging trends of DDoS attacks is hyper volumetric floods; these attacks generate traffic of over a staggering 1Tbps (terabits per second). Terabit DDoS attacks are a significant threat to organizations. They can quickly overwhelm a network infrastructure and disrupt critical services. As a result, implementing a state-of-the-art terabit DDoS mitigation solution is crucial for organizations to protect themselves against these devastating attacks.
Here are some of the largest recorded volumetric attacks:
Google Services was targeted with a volumetric attack of 2.54Tbps.
Amazon AWS Infrastructure was targeted with a 2.3Tbps attack.
Microsoft Azure reported three terabit attacks: one of 3.47Tbps and two others that were over 2.5Tbps.

In May 2021, Radware Cloud Services successfully mitigated a hyper volumetric DDoS attack that peaked at almost 1.5Tbps. This volumetric, carpet-bombing attack against the targeted subnet lasted for thirty-six hours. It had a sustained throughput of over 700Gbps for more than 8 hours.
The total volume generated by this attack was 2.9Pbps, which was one-and-a-half times the information contained in all U.S. academic research libraries. And it was all successfully blocked.
Terabit volumetric floods are here to stay, and a proper mitigation device is a must!
2. Nielsen’s Law of Bandwidth Capacity still holds true
Nielsen’s Law of Internet Bandwidth states that a user’s bandwidth grows 50% each year. It has held true for the past 40 years, from 1983 to 2023. This, along with 5G and 6G networks moving forward, proves human consumption and needed speed rate demands are enormous. Rest assured this won’t slow down any time soon.
To support this increasing demand, data centers, carriers, service providers and cloud platforms must keep up with the vast amounts of data. They have already adopted the latest network technology that has introduced 400G network infrastructure for high bandwidth and faster data transmission speeds. What’s needed is a DDoS mitigation platform that will support these high throughput rates. They will need to keep up with the demanding throughput by having 400G data ports that can sustain and process detection and mitigation.

3. Scale And Performance for Unbeatable Mitigation Capabilities
So, how can you protect your organization against Terabit DDoS attacks that send huge amounts of traffic toward your assets all at once?
The answer lies in implementing a scalable and robust state-of-the-art DDoS mitigation solution. Ensure the vendor you choose offers protection level tiers. To achieve unbeatable levels of mitigation against Terabit DDoS attacks, deploy the following:
a. Multi-Layered Protection
A multi-layered approach is crucial in mitigating Terabit DDoS attacks. This involves deploying a combination of the right network infrastructure, a mitigation appliance that can handle ultra-high-end rates and cloud-based solutions to ensure you have a diverse range of defenses.
b. Traffic Scrubbing
Traffic scrubbing involves filtering out malicious traffic from legitimate traffic, enabling your network to remain online during an attack. A dedicated and robust DDoS mitigation hardware platform is great for combating Terabit DDoS attacks, but that isn’t enough. On the software side, you need a behavioral DDoS countermeasure approach to make sure attacks are quickly detected and traffic is automatically filtered. This lets legitimate traffic in while keeping attack traffic out.
c. High Port Density, Scale and Performance Without Compromise
To handle huge amounts of traffic, whether during peacetime or while under attack, the mitigation platform hardware and software must be capable of handling high volumetric rates; very few can accomplish this.
Picking the right platform is key. Whether deploying the detection and mitigation platform inline or out-of-path will ensure a sustainable, clean and DDoS-free environment for customers.
To protect large network infrastructures, such as carriers, Tier-1 service providers and large enterprises, the mitigation platform must support high port density to inspect incoming traffic, remove threats and pass legitimate traffic to the protected network without creating a bottleneck. It should include several 100G data ports, and, if possible, 400G data ports. This will enable it to accommodate large network infrastructures.
d. High Visibility and Simplified Management
Having high visibility and simplified management are crucial aspects of a DDoS mitigation platform. High visibility of the network and packet flow ensures that network administrators have clear and concise information, whether during peacetime or during an attack. Information should include the attack’s origin, the type of attack and the impact on the network. This information is vital in helping administrators make informed decisions on how to best mitigate the attack and reduce damage(s). Additionally, simplified management makes it easier for administrators to configure and manage the DDoS mitigation platform efficiently. This is particularly important in high-pressure situations where time is of the essence; the faster mitigation is implemented, the better. Having the right management solution that allows you to gain visibility and control your high-end mitigation platform(s) is critical. The right high-end mitigation platform, along with a great management and analytics system, ensures organizations can effectively and efficiently protect their networks from Terabit DDoS attacks. Doing so will minimize disruptions to operations and ensure systems and customers remain up and running and are secure.

Conclusion
Threats from Terabit DDoS attacks continue to grow. These hyper-volume attacks mean organizations need to take the necessary steps to protect themselves. By implementing a multi-layered approach, traffic scrubbing with the right mitigation platform, scalable infrastructure readiness and relying on a seamless, easy-to-use management system, organizations can greatly reduce the risk of a devastating attack.
Remember, prevention is always better than a cure. That’s why it’s crucial to be proactive when protecting your network from massive, overwhelming Terabit DDoS attacks.

Radware Adds a New Weapon to its DDoS-Fighting Arsenal

In case you haven’t heard, DDoS isn’t going away anytime soon. Need proof? In 2022, DDoS attacks rose by over 100% to approximately 20 million attacks. And they’re getting more sophisticated, to boot. DDoS attacks can come in the form of protocol, volumetric, application layer attacks, or a combination of them all. Attack vectors are opening up like never before. And the attacks aren’t the only thing increasing. So, too, are the consequences. It’s estimated that, on average, a DDoS attack can cost a business as much as $35,000 per hour.

Ukraine’s Response to Cyber Threats a Model in DDoS Prevention
With the disruption, loss of life and heartbreaking images that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has produced, it is easy to overlook what it has meant to the cyber threat landscape. Even threat actors have taken sides. While it’s easy to imagine hackers working alone in a dark room from a remote location, that imagery now needs to include some indication that it’s taking place in a government office. That’s because much of the cybercrime committed — at least related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict — has been state-sponsored.
Killnet — From Business To State-Sponsored Threat Actor
In March 2022, pro-Kremlin hacktivist Killnet released a video pledging their support of Russia. Soon after — as in a couple minutes — it launched dozens of DDoS (distributed denial of service) and DoS (denial of service) attacks against governments and private organizations that supported Ukraine. After the attack, Killnet would hop on victims’ websites and publish pro-Russia messaging. Their mission statement changed radically in only two months (Killnet first emerged in January 2022 as a hack-for-hire vendor selling DDoS tools). Now they launch the attacks using their own resources.
Ukraine’s Efforts Serve As A Great DDoS Mitigation Model
While each of the western countries attacked quickly deployed DDoS prevention solutions, Ukraine’s response provides a great example of quick, responsive threat mitigation.
Responsible for protecting state information resources, Ukraine’s SSCIP (State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection) promptly implemented measures to protect, among other things, its web applications and communications systems. They decided on an industry leading cloud DDoS protection and web application firewall solution (WAF) to enhance its defenses against ongoing, volumetric attacks.
Cloud DDoS Protection
Ukraine selected a cloud DDoS protection solution that provides behavioral-based detection for application- (L7) and network-layer (L3/4) attacks. To protect against zero-day attacks, the solution provides automatic, real-time signatures that protect against zero-day attacks. In addition, Ukraine’s solution provides unique SSL/TLS DDoS protection and flexible deployment options for both cloud-based and hybrid cloud environments.
Ukraine’s solution also gives them the ability to drill down into each asset and quickly view all historical and current information. They can perform a quick, deep and thorough analysis of their network.
Scrubbing centers located throughout the world support the solution. They are fully meshed and have at least 10Tbps of mitigation capacity. Their widespread locations means mitigation takes place as close to the attack’s origin as possible, so traffic does not impact Ukraine’s infrastructure.
Web Application Firewall (WAF) Solution
With the increased availability of web applications and ever-expanding DevOps CI/CD pipelines — and attack vectors that are growing as a result — Ukraine understood the importance of selecting a WAF solution that provides comprehensive protection and guards against data breaches. Their solution is adaptive and detects and protects applications through automatic policy generation as each application is added to Ukraine’s network.
In addition to DDoS protection and a WAF solution, Ukraine’s SSCIP made sure its selected vendor provides a 24×7 real-time emergency response team and round-the-clock risk mitigation. In short, Ukraine’s cyber defenses represent what is needed to combat threat actors like Killnet.
Digital Combat Needs a Different Kind of Warrior        
Like the first two industrial revolutions (mass production and the steam engine), the third, the digital revolution, has provided countless benefits that help people stay more connected, informed, safe and healthy. But as fast as benefits have been ushered in, people and organizations with destructive goals have slipped through the door. That’s why it’s so important to get the best solution(s) available to keep your organization safe, whether a government agency, business, healthcare facility, or countless others. Turning to security experts like the tenured, talented professionals at Radware is a perfect first step to help ensure your organization is protected against the digital threats of the day.

Visibility into Peacetime Traffic. Is it Too Much to Expect From Your DDoS Protection Provider?
Today, everyone has at least one insurance policy. It could be a healthcare, automobile, or life insurance policy. We invest heavily in these policies and have high expectations for a return on our investment when the unforeseen happens and we need the protections they provide. But most of us don’t expect anything from our insurance companies during “peacetime” — a period of time when there are no incidents or accidents.
Making peacetime part of the service policy
While a DDoS protection solution resembles an insurance policy in many ways, it should perform even better. Organizations should expect a high degree of service and network visibility from their security providers even during peacetime.
However, like insurance companies, most cyber security companies don’t service their clients during peacetime. Many clients simply do not expect it from their vendors, just like we as consumers don’t expect it from our insurance companies.
At Radware, we believe that clients should expect more from their security vendors. That’s why we are committed to servicing clients when they are under attack, during peacetime — and all year round.

Proactive protection in peacetime
As part of our Cloud DDoS Protection Service, Radware is offering a new Cloud Network Analytics Service, which offers full visibility into network traffic, both during peacetime and when under attack. Network managers will now have a complete picture (see Figure 1) of non-aggregated daily traffic data, spanning 90 days.
Figure 1: Overview of Radware’s Cloud Network Analytics Management System
The new service provides analytics and visibility across four key areas: network traffic visibility, services in use, access privileges management, and client-server traffic.
Network Traffic Visibility: Our Cloud Network Analytics Service reports on the exact amount of traffic moving across an organization’s network at any given time. Understanding network consumption enables more effective network planning and deployment to avoid scaling and sizing issues (See Figure 2). For instance, having detailed data about peacetime traffic in hand can be particularly valuable for organizations working with service providers to size the right network. Clear visibility into peacetime traffic leads to more accurate planning and pricing, and ultimately reduces the costs associated with unnecessary bandwidth.
Figure 2: Visibility into the network traffic
[You may also like: DDoS Protection in the Age of 5G Networks, Edge Computing and Explosive Bandwidth Growth]
Services in Use: Our analytics service offers a detailed overview of and the ability to monitor services in use, such as HTTPS, DNS, internet browsing, VoIP, file downloading, and more. That way organizations can make sure their services are used for the right purpose (see Figure 3). For example, an unexpected and unusual spike in use is a flag that a service should be investigated.
Figure 3: Services in use
Access Privileges Management: To ensure users have proper access to the right systems, our Cloud Network Analytics Service maps users and their access privileges as well as the specific IP addresses and geographies that can access an organization’s services (see Figure 4).
Figure 4: The top sources countries accessing the service
Client-Server Traffic: Our new service also quantifies the amount of traffic flowing between each client to the server, monitoring conversations and making sure users aren’t abusing server conversations or resources. This type of reporting is helpful in detecting the possible abuse of credentials.
It is finally time for companies to demand a little more than the obvious from their security providers and start getting their money’s worth. Even if used in different settings and circumstances, data about peacetime traffic is just as valuable as data about attack traffic — and no one should settle for less.

Q1 2022 DDoS and Application Attack Activity: An Overview
The cybersecurity threat landscape in the first quarter of 2022 represented a mix bag of old enemies and new foes. New actors dominated the DDoS threat landscape while application security faced tried-and-true attack vectors.
These attacks were largely driven by a threat landscape turbocharged by geopolitical instability, hacktivists, nation-state threat actors, and a focus on exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities. A detailed analysis of real-world network and application attack activity from the first quarter of 2022 can be found in Radware’s new Quarterly DDoS & Application Threat Analysis Hub. Review the highlights below for some surprising results.
DDoS Attack Trends
In DDoS, the number of micro floods increased by 125% in the first quarter of 2022 versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Micro floods are low throughput attack vectors with throughputs below 1Gbps but above 10Mbps. They typically fly under the radar and cannot be detected using traditional algorithms or techniques that spot larger throughput attack vectors based solely on thresholds. By combining a large number of micro floods or adding micro floods to a mix of mid-sized and large attack vectors, attackers can significantly increase the complexity of their attack campaigns. Attackers can make mitigation harder by forcing mitigators to constantly adapt their policies.
Additionally, the number of blocked malicious events (per customer) rose nearly 75% compared to first quarter of 2021. However, overall blocked volumes (in TBs) decreased dramatically. The education and telecommunication sectors took the brunt of DDoS attacks, representing 67% of DDoS attack volume in the first three months of 2022, while the Americas represented over half of DDoS attack volumes during the same time period.
Application Attack Trends
In terms of application attack activity, malicious bot activity increased dramatically. Bad bot transactions increased by 126% in the first quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter of 2021. Cross referencing application attack data against the OWASP Top 10 application security violations shows that Broken Access Control (A01 in OWASP 2021) represented over half of all blocked security violations during the first quarter of 2022.
[You may also like: Why Organizations are Failing to Manage Rising Bot Attacks]
High tech (31%) and the retail sector (27%) faced the majority of application attacks during the first quarter of 2022. Telecommunications/carriers finished in third place at 21%.
Lastly, Predictable Resource Location, Code Injections and SQL Injections were fan favorites of threat actors, and represented the top three application violations, respectively, in the first quarter of 2022.
DDoS and Application Threat Landscape Analysis
The first quarter of 2022 was marked by geopolitical, hacktivist denial-of-service, and nation-state vulnerability-focused cyberactivity.
Following the invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of hybrid warfare, Radware monitored an increase in denial-of-service attacks targeting both the Russian and Ukrainian governments and associated financial institutions. The increase in denial-of-service activity was driven mostly by patriotic hacktivism from pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian activists. The IT Army of Ukraine brought hacking to the masses, including teens, via gamification of denial-of-service attacks. This included the playforukraine[.]com website, where in-game achievements are websites you helped disrupt while playing. WordPress websites were breached and injected with malicious code to perform denial-of-service attacks upon loading the webpage. Any visitor of the breached WordPress sites became a bot, performing application-level, denial-of-service attacks that were targeted at a list of websites curated by the authors of the malicious code.
[You may also like: Is DDoS a Crime?]
In an act of protest against the invasion of Ukraine, the maintainer of a popular Node.js module called ‘node-ipc’, deliberately sabotaged his module. The module, providing local and remote inter process communication (IPC), is leveraged by many neural network and machine-learning tools. The developer altered his code to deliberately corrupt files on systems running applications that depend on the node-ipc module, but only if the systems were geolocated in either Russia or Belarus.
The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector became a prime target for attacks. Crypto exchanges faced denial-of-service attacks following their ban of Russian citizens. Crypto exchanges were also the target of financially motivated attacks by ppp state-sponsored threat actors.
A new vulnerability was discovered in the Java Spring framework, a popular framework for building online applications. Following its public disclosure at the end of March after a Chinese researcher published a proof-of-concept on Github, Spring4shell was quickly exploited and required businesses to quickly patch applications leveraging the Java Spring framework.
OpIsrael, a yearly operation targeting Israelian businesses and citizens, was nearly nonexistent this year due to Anonymous’ focus on the Russian/Ukrainian conflict. OpsBedil, a hacktivist operation targeting Middle Eastern organizations in 2021, returned this year. OpsBedil is considered the replacement for the now-defunct OpIsrael operations. The new OpsBedil operations were conducted by DragonForce Malaysia and its affiliates throughout Southeast Asia, specifically Malaysia and Indonesia. The current operation, OpsBedilReloaded, is considered a political response to events that occurred in Israel on April 11, 2022. During OpsBedilReloaded, hacktivists executed website defacements, sensitive data leaks and denial-of-service attacks. Based on previous OpsBedil TTPs, attack campaigns can be expected to run through April, May and potentially into the June/July timeframe. Hacktivist campaigns like OpsBedil, while nowhere close to as notorious as OpIsrael once was, present a renewed level of risk for the region. Unlike Anonymous, DragonForce Malaysia and its affiliates have the time, the resources and the motivation to execute these attacks and present a moderate-level threat to Israel.

Radware Mitigates 1.1Tbps DDoS Attack
As more businesses migrate critical resources and applications to the public cloud, attackers are adapting their tactics and techniques to match the scale of public cloud providers. Last week, this trend played out as reality for one of the world’s largest service providers when it was hit by a 1.1 Tbps DDoS attack (Figure 1) that lasted approximately 36 hours. Here’s how this U.S. provider’s story unfolded.
Figure 1* Radware 2021–2022 Global Threat Analysis Report
The First Wave
The clock started ticking when this U.S. service provider noticed a service impact. At first, the service provider, which serves millions of businesses worldwide, intended to mitigate the attack using its on-premise solution as it usually does. However, a decision was quickly made to route all traffic through Radware’s Cloud DDoS Protection Service when the high-volume, multi-vector attack was too complex to handle locally.
Within a few minutes after the first call to Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) hotline, the service provider’s assets were onboarded to Radware Cloud DDoS Protection Service and mitigation started.
During the first five hours of the attack, traffic peaked at 150 Gbps. The top attack vectors included UDP flood, UDP fragmentation flood, fragmented ACK and PSH flood, and NTP reflection (Figure 2). With UDP flood attacks, the attacker intends to saturate the victim’s internet pipes by sending large UDP packets to a single destination or to a random port. With fragmented ACK and PSH flood attacks, on the other hand, the attacker uses very small byte packets to hog the target network’s bandwidth using only a moderate packet rate. Radware’s ERT security experts worked in collaboration with the new customer to understand normal traffic patterns and immediately applied the relevant mitigation to fully block the first wave of the attack.

The Second Wave
Six hours into the incident, the second wave of the attack began, with traffic peaking at over 300 Gbps. Based on evidence gathered primarily from indicators of compromise, the attack traffic appeared to have originated primarily from Japan, the United States, Taiwan, and sss (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Top source countries, generating the attack traffic
At this point, the unrelenting attack continued. Trying to disrupt service to the provider, approximately 150Gbps of traffic lasted for an additional three hours, before peaking at 1.1 Tbps.
The barrage of attack traffic was fully mitigated leveraging the capacity of only four of the scrubbing centers in Radware’s global network. The scrubbing centers were located in the United States and EMEA (Figure 4).
Figure 4: Total traffic managed by Radware’s scrubbing centers during the 1.1 Tbps peak
Post Peak
Post peak, approximately 800 Gbps of attack traffic continued for more than nine hours until the attacker’s resources were exhausted by Radware’s Cloud DDoS Protection mitigation and ERT experts.
As of the time of this blog, no hacktivist organization has assumed responsibility for the attack.

Is this just the beginning?
It is impossible to ignore the wave of hyper-volumetric DDoS attacks that have been recorded in 2022. While 2021 saw only a few 1Tbps attacks, attacks of 1Tbps and more are becoming a new reality this year.
As bandwidths and resources increase for legitimate businesses, they also increase for threat actors. It is only fair to assume that bad actors can scale as fast and high as their targets. Organizations need to be aware that DDoS attacks are a part of their threat landscape, irrespective of geography or industry.
Radware’s Cloud DDoS Protection Services protect organizations of all sizes from a wide variety from sectors, ranging from education, e-commerce, retail, and global financial services to worldwide governments, and leading service providers and carriers. It is safe to say that no organization, regardless of what they do or where they are located, are immune from attack.

Is DDoS a Crime?
2022 has a serious ‘DDoS is not a crime’ vibe. Little over four weeks ago, performing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks was not without potential consequences. As an activist, one will need to consider those facts before taking up arms.
Personally, I feel the general public views hackers in one of two ways. They are either evil threat actors or hacktivists fighting for a cause. Hackers are rarely portrayed as altruistic thinkers who follow the law.
Terms like outcasts, rebels, and criminals frequently come up when describing hackers in the media. Even movies and TV shows glorify the malicious actions of hackers to the general public without a second thought about their impact. So, it comes as no surprise that we have a distorted perception in today’s digital society when it comes to the legalities of hacking.
And I can hardly blame the public at this point. For years, the community has warned about the consequences of failing to regulate criminal activity. An inexperienced person might naively believe that launching a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is perfectly legal. After all, users can easily find attack tools for rent on the first page of an internet search engine. And even worse and more perplexing for the average user, criminal sites offering DDoS services are often protected by legitimate security firms, giving the illusion that they are legal at some level.
The Gray Area of Cyber
Not only has the security industry failed to regulate the blatant criminal activity, but we as a community also seem to be rewarding malicious behavior with attention, leading emotionally compromised and overstimulated first-time hackers to publicly and proudly announce their association with criminal activity. Often they believe their newfound power and moral high ground justify any crime they may have committed and fit the narrative of ethical hacking.   
While this gray area was tolerated back in the days of Anonymous, today, the hive mindset has evolved and become mainstream. As a result, a more significant percentage of the general public believe that DDoS attacks are not a crime if they are morally aligned and part of a socially acceptable operation.  
[You may also like: What Drives DDoS Attacks and Why it Should be a Concern]
But is this true?
Take the current Russia-Ukraine war, for example. Both sides of the conflict have created government-backed IT armies that have recruited tens of thousands of people from around the world. Their objectives range from essential information operations and support to organized Denial-of-Service attacks against government agencies, financial institutions, and even food delivery services.  
While both sides have justified their reasons for carrying out cyber-attacks in support of the war, is it legal for someone outside of Russia or Ukraine to join a foreign cyber legion and engage in cyberwar? 
Or take the recent disclosure by the musician Grimes, who admitted during a Vanity Fair interview to orchestrating a Denial-of-Service attack in 2012 against the now-defunct blog Hipster Runoff. The attack kept the website offline until the owner agreed to remove the article containing a personal photo of her.   
Grimes admitted to a federal crime during this interview. But we must ask ourselves, why did she feel safe to admit to her “coolest hacker moment” publicly? Was it a branding and marketing stunt? Or has hacking, specifically, Denial-of-Service attacks, become so socially acceptable that society no longer views the action as a crime?  
Risks and Consequences of launching a DDoS attack
Perception is reality, but nothing is what it seems. And while launching Denial-of-Service attacks might currently be perceived as a hip and trendy activity to be a part of, it is still very much, in reality, a federal crime. For example, in 2021, a man received the maximum sentence of five years in federal prison and was ordered to pay more than $520,000 in restitution for launching multiple DDoS attacks against media outlets, bloggers, and legal news sites.  
There are also many risks associated with joining a foreign cyber legion, especially if you are not located within a country participating in the conflict. Just because you feel morally or socially compelled to engage doesn’t mean that your actions will be considered legal and without consequence. Even if you happen to get away with operating during the conflict and your side is victorious, you could still face legal charges or travel restrictions for years to come due to your involvement. 
Additionally, in both situations, what appears to be a justifiable and straightforward Denial-of-Service attack against the enemy can cause collateral damage to unintended and unrelated targets while in transit. Packets don’t just magically jump from their origin to their destination. When an attacker crafts and sends malicious packets across the internet, that traffic can cause service-related issues for network operators.

Should I Join the Cyber War?
DDoS is, until further notice from the authorities, considered a federal crime. It is surprising that the security industry and government officials do not inform the general public about the risks and collateral damage that can be caused by performing DDoS attacks as part of cyber warfare. This could explain the perception problem with respect to the legalities of hacking. It’s almost like they want people to get involved, which is fine… if you are smart about it.  
Launching offensive cyber-attacks and DDoS attacks are a crime, and with hacking back there is a lot of risk and liability involved. If you are truly passionate about an event and feel obligated to get involved, consider that Anonymous’ greatest power did not come from their cyber-attacks. It came from the organization and dissemination of information.

DDoS Protection in the Age of 5G Networks, Edge Computing and Explosive Bandwidth Growth
Network transformation is having a direct impact on cybersecurity. New and improved scalability, agility and bandwidth are benefiting not just legitimate users – but also bad actors. And service providers need to be prepared.
Service providers embrace edge-centric computing in their fixed and mobile networks to deliver better user experiences, better performance and emerging real-time services. However, more scalable infrastructures, high traffic bandwidth, advance connectivity, and different network architecture also impact the cybersecurity threat landscape. The same capabilities that allow service providers to raise the bar on performance and introduce new services also allow bad actors to execute larger, more sophisticated cyberattacks. 
Network Transformation Impact
The findings of Radware’s 2021–2022 Global Threat Analysis Report show the real impact of network transformations on cyberattacks. Between 2020-2021, average DDoS attack volumes grew by 26%, and the number of malicious DDoS events increased by 37%. To safeguard their infrastructures from the rise in attacks, DDoS mitigation is a protective measure that service providers must implement. Two of the main types of DDoS threats are volumetric attacks and phantom floods attacks. While phantom flood attacks often fly below the radar of service providers, both types of attacks can be disruptive and must be addressed.

Volumetric Attacks
While less common, terabit attacks are still a threat. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Microsoft Azure reported three terabit attacks, one with a size of 3.47Tbps and two more above 2.5Tbps. Terabit attacks can overwhelm any internet uplinks. Once the uplinks are saturated, customers and partners are left without available service.
Multi-terabit attacks are not necessarily more effective or dangerous than gigabit attacks. In the first few weeks of 2022, during the Twitch Rivals SquidCraft Games event hosted in Andorra, a DDoS attack no larger than 100Gbps interrupted the connectivity of the entire country for hours on end. 
Volumetric attacks are a by-product of the growth in traffic bandwidth. High bandwidth attacks can range from 10Gbps up to terabits. Service providers without the right DDoS protection can suffer from access and services outages, which can have a real impact on revenue. 
Figure 1* Radware 2021–2022 Global Threat Analysis Report
Phantom Flood Attacks
Another growing DDoS trend is phantom floods attacks. Micro floods and other slower attacks, such as application-layer attacks, can go undetected and consume resources. Service providers and their end consumers are unaware of the constant increase of infrastructure resources, such as bandwidth, network, and server processing, until the service becomes cost-prohibitive.  
* Radware 2021–2022 Global Threat Analysis Report
DDoS Protection and Network Transformation
Networks and market requirements are constantly changing, As a result, new eco-systems, architectures and advanced solutions emerge, which all affect the DDoS threat landscape.
Service providers should seek DDoS security solutions that support new infrastructure innovations and requirements while overcoming the increasing intensity of large DDoS attacks and growing sophistication of phantom flood attacks.

What Drives DDoS Attacks and Why it Should be a Concern
What is a DDoS Attack?  
DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Let’s ignore the Distributed for now as it refers mainly to the technique and let’s focus on the Denial of Service first. As the term implies, the objective of a DoS attack is to disrupt or deny services from legitimate users. A service can be anything including web sites that provide information, online services such as ecommerce sites or backend services such as payment processing, the communication between organizations and cloud applications, the connectivity of remote internet controlled industrial processes or sensors.  
The objectives of the attacks include defacement, creating an impact on the economy of an organization or nation by impacting productivity, creating chaos, or as a smoke screen to hide another attack. Overwhelming a network with random traffic will distract the defenders and give attackers the opportunity and time to perform malicious activity on the side while going undetected as defenders are focusing on the most impacting issue which is the Denial of Service attack. 
Depending on the objective, denial of service attacks can be performed in different ways. A volumetric denial of service attack for example aims at saturating connections to the service or between organizations and the cloud or between branches and headquarters basically hampering all legitimate communications and stopping all data traffic.  
A Denial of Service attack can also be targetted at a specific service like a website, an API or a Domain Name Service (DNS) in which case the resources of the server are the target. Such application layer or L7 attacks can completely disrupt the service or they can be more insiduous like low and slow attacks that eat away at resources and impact the user experience, forcing the owner of the service to invest in more resources such as CPU, memory or bandwidth to sustain an acceptable level of service. If such attacks go undetected for a long time, they can drain the economic viability of a business or service.  
Another type of Denial of Service attacks, exceptional but still important enough to consider as a threat, are vulnerabilities in software or hardware that can result in the crash of a process, halting or rebooting of a device, just by sending malformed packets. A single packet can result in processes exciting without reason or long reboot cycles and can be very disruptive if not discovered timely. Given the attack consist of a single packet, finding the culprit amongst millions of packets and connections can be a daunting task and mostly these attack are discovered by analyzing the crash dumps of kernels or processes. Most of these exploits have a short lifetime because once the vulnerability is discovered, it can be patched and updating systems or network signatures can easily prevent this attack. Nonetheless, the come around from time to time. 
Performing a Denial of Service attack does not require extensive skill or specific knowledge, in most cases it requires knowledge of the location of the service, its IP address for example and enough powerful infrastructure to perform the attack. The attack infrastructure can consist of cloud servers, but attackers can also leverage a growing range of consumer and prosumer IoT devices such as IP cameras and routers and enslave them to perform large scale distributed attacks. Because attack traffic originates from all parts of the globe and from different devices, we refer to these attacks as Distributed Denial of service attacks.  
What a DDoS Attack is not 
As you followed along, you probably noted that there is no infiltration of networks or breaching of servers involved in Denial of Service attacks. An organization that suffered a Denial of service attack will not be subject to stolen data or have persisting malicious software in their infrastructure as a result. With the exception of DDoS as a smokescreen, once the DDoS attack stops, the organization can recover its services and continue its operations, very much unlike ransomware where the organization is typically left in an inoperative state until it recovers or restores its internal systems, and even them it can take days, weeks or months to fully recover all services and operations.  
The flip side, however, is that attackers can perform DDoS attacks with very little worries about being caught. Leveraging IoT devices, spoofing and reflection, it becomes very difficult, near impossible even, to attribute the traffic to specific actors. The threshold to perfom a DDoS attack is by consequence much lower compared to infiltrating and extracting information from private networks. 
How big is the threat from DoS attacks? Which organizations or industries are particularly at risk? Who are the actors behind those crimes? What are they after and what motivates them? 
Starting 2020 we have witnessed a surge in DDoS activity driven by Ransom DoS campaigns that have become a persistent part of the DDoS threat landscape as well as several political and sociological events like elections, #blacklivesmatter and struggles inside and between nations.  
To understand the threat and assess the risk for your organization, you need to understand the actors, who they are and what their objectives are. Know how they typically perform attacks. The tactics and techniques leveraged by malicious actors will depend on their objective and skill level. And finally, the actor requires something that is of value to you that he can impact – this is where the opportunities for malicious actors lie and typically consist of important and valuable assets or vulnerabilities.

Organized crime 
Ransomware has seen enormous growth and evolution in tactics by operators and affiliates that are getting better organized. Ransomware operators have evolved their tactics to triple extortion, not only encrypting systems but exfiltrating sensitive data and threatening to publish the data for a ransom. If the victim does not comply or resists, they resort to DDoS attacks to get their victims back to the negotiation table.  
Since August 2020 we have seen Denial of Service extortion or Ransom DoS campaigns targeting all verticals across the globe. Campaigns that were very persisting and where actors posing as Fancy Bear, Lazarus group or the Armada collective sent threatening email messages to organizations. Threathening the organization that they were chosen as the target for their next DDoS attack, refering to some of their previous work and continuing that they they will start a large DDoS attack very soon. To prove their threats are to be taken serious, they will perform a small attack using just a fraction of their attack infrastructure on a given asset of the threatened organization. 
To avoid the attack they propose to pay a ransom of 10 to 20 bitcoin to a specific bitcoin address. Failing to pay before the attacks start will increase the fee with 5 or 10 bitcoin for every missed deadline while the attack continues. 
Between october and november, the ransom letters seem to slow and eb away. Until second half of december where we started to hear from customers receiving new letters. Organizations that were targeted before and received a ransom letter were now subject to a second letter that said the attackers were busy with more profitable projects and they are now back. They refer to the same bitcoin address and ask for a ransom between 5 and 10 bitcoin. The lower ransom was explained by the rise in bitcoin value that surged in December to over a 100% increase compared to earlier that year. They said they would never give up and they will always come back until they are paid. 
Come March of 2021 and as we started to put the last Ransom DoS campaign behind us, it would only take until May when new letters started to surface. This time a group, most probably unrelated to the actors from the previous campaigns, was posing as ‘Fancy Lazarus’. A moniker invented specifically to instill even more fear into victims by combining Fancy Bear, the russian APT, known for its ties to the russian governoment and promoting the political interests of the Russian government and the group believed to be responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee emails in an attempt to influence the outcome of the United States 2016 presidential elections, cyber attacks on the German and Norwegian parliaments, the French television station TV5Monde, the White House, NATO, and attempting to influence the campaign of French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron. 
And Lazarus Group, the ppp APT believed to be a state-sponsored hacking organization responsible for the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures, the 2016 bank hiest on the Bangladesh bank where they successfully got away with 81 million USD. This time the malicious actor or group were primarily targeting unprotected assets from organizations in different verticals. Asking for a 0.5 to 5 bitcoin ransom to prevent the attack. 
September of 2021 was marked by service impacting DDoS attacks on VoIP telecommunications providers in the United Kingdom and Canada. Starting September 1, UK South Coast–based VoIP operator Voip Unlimited disclosed it was hit by a sustained and large-scale DDoS attack it believed originated from the Russian ransomware group “REvil” following what they described as a “colossal ransom demand.” After 75 hours of continuous attacks, on September 3, Voip Unlimited reported a pause in malicious traffic and confirmed a few days later that they did not observe any further attacks. At the same time, also starting September 1, the London-based Voipfone reported suffering outages on voice services, inbound and outbound calls, and SMS services. It was later confirmed to customers via e-mail that Voipfone services had been “intermittently disrupted by a DDoS attack.” On September 16, a Canadian provider of telephony services, VoIP.ms, announced it became aware of issues preventing customers from accessing its website and were working toward a solution.  
One week later, the issue was still ongoing and was attributed to persistent aggressive DDoS attacks causing disruptions in phone calls and services. Public messages exchanged on Twitter between VoIP.ms and the threat actors going by the handle @REvil92457183 provided more insights. The threat actors behind the DDoS assault went by the name ”REvil,” but there is no evidence they represent the same REvil ransomware gang that is known to have previously attacked prominent companies, including the world’s largest meat processor, JBS. As a ransomware operator, it is not conforming to the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of REvil to perform DDoS extortion attacks. It cannot be excluded, though. It would not be the first time a criminal group is diversifying its activities. 
A now-removed Pastebin note put the initial ransom demand at 1 bitcoin, or a little over US$42,000 (at the time of publishing). However, only two days after the initial demand, the @REvil92457183 twitter account increased the demand to 100 bitcoins, or over US$4.2 million, when it messaged: ”Ok, enough communication… The price for us to stop is now 100 Bitcoin into the pastebin BTC address. I am sure your customers will appreciate your 0 f…s given attitude in multiple law suits. REvil”. The actors used Twitter to expose the attacks and condemn VoIP.ms for not paying, in an attempt to make its customers and partners put pressure on the service provider to pay the ransom and rid them of service disruptions. Ransomware operators use similar pressure tactics, such as leaking new victims and sensitive data obtained from victims on their dark web PR sites. Messages from VoIP.ms on Twitter show that the attacks were initially targeting VoIP.ms’ domain name services. VoIP.ms mitigated these attacks by asking partners and customers to hardcode service IP addresses in their systems. 
On October 7, Voip Unlimited again reported intermittent loss of connectivity and voice services as its engineers were working to mitigate DDoS attacks against its telephony platforms. Issues were first reported on its service status webpage in the evening on October 7. In the evening on October 8, VoIP Unlimited was still reporting disruptions caused by ongoing DDoS attacks against its customers. 
Hacktivist 
Much the opposite of the organized crime, these malicious actors are not driven by financial gain but mainly by political or ideological ideas. They are out for defacement, doxing and destruction or disruption of websites and resources, all with the aim to promote a political agenda or a social change. Businesses can become entangled and in the crosshairs of hacktivists wihtout even having control over the situation. These groups are typcially unsophisticated but rely on their large following and social media to perform and promote attack campaigns. They use private forums to distribute and educate their followers on denial of service tools. These tools are typcially ancient and very simple, well known and publicly available. Yet, in the hands of a large enough crowd, these simple attack tools become very effective distributed weapons. In the recent attack campaigns orchestrated by the politically oriented hactivist group Dragon Force Malaysia, tools like torshammer, low and high orbit ion canon also known as LOIC and HOIC, and a mobile attack tool for Android called Garuda, were leveraged in cyber attacks against Israeli targets throughout the month June and July 2021 to protest against the strengthening of diplomatic ties beween the Israeli governemnt and Southeast Asia’s Muslim-majority nations. 
Disgruntled employees and angry customers 
Another group of typically lesser sophisticated attackers, operating as lone-wolfs, are disgruntled employees and angry customers. The gaming and betting industry is frequently targetted by unhappy customers that act on flaring emotions and driven by anger upon losing large amounts of money in bets. But we also see this group across other verticals, like when a website is advertising wrong information, an incorrect or unadequate delivery of goods or services, etc. 
Given their needs for immediate and temporal access to an adequate tool, this group mostly resorts to publicly available DDoS-as-a-Service portals that provide convenient and subscription based access to DDoS botnets and attack servers. In just a few clicks these actors can easily disrupt online resrouces and harm the reputation of businesses. 
[You may also like: 2021 Year in Review: Denial of Service]
Nation states 
Nation States on the other hand have the expertise and resources to build vast weapons of destruction, in the physical as well as in the cyber world. Mostly known for using cyber weapons to cause disruption and chaos in an attempt to destabilize economies or regimes. Critical infrastructure such as power grids, fuel pipelines, water supply, but also financial institutions can be the target of competing nations and fall victim to large scale attacks, amongst which DDoS are very effective as attribution is so hard and one of the prime objectives of nation state attacks is not to get caught in the act or trying to influence foreign politics by blaming another nation. 
Competitors 
Finally, I want to highlight a frequently forgotten threat group that is more present than most would suspect: competitors. Unsurprisingly, this group’s aim is to get competitive advantage by destroying the reputation, stealing intellectual property or undercutting prices of competing businesses and nations. This group will resort to automated attack tools such a bots to scrape information, some will hire attackers to disrupt services while other will step up the game and sponsor groups to infiltrate and steal confidential and sensitive information.  
In the aftermath of the Mirai botnet attacks against Krebs, OVH and Dyn DNS, an actor going by the name of ‘best buy’ was observed and stopped while trying to enslave 900,000 of Deutsche Telecom’s consumer internet modems. Bestbuy, or Daniel Kaye in real life, already owned a 400,000 bot Mirai based botnet at the time. He started his project after being hired by the CEO of Cellcom Liberia to destroy the reputation of Lonestar MTN, Cellcom’s largest competitor in Liberia. Daniel started his attacks through the most renowned stresser service at the time: ‘vDoS’. vDoS didn’t provide him the power needed to disrupt a large mobile organization such as Lonestar. Given the then recent publication of the Mirai botnet source code, he picked up the code and build his own botnet. In November 2016, in an attempt to disrupt the services of Lonestar MTN, Daniel Kaye, hacker-for-hire, disrupted the internet connectivity of the whole of Liberia. Daniel Kaye was apprehended in January 2019 in Luton Airport in London UK while travelling home to Cyprus after meeting with his Cellcom contact. 
Which tools and techniques do attackers prefer to use for DoS attacks?  
Actors who are less sophisticated will reach for DDoS-as-a-Service portals. These portals are widely available on the clear net and can be found through simple Google search. DDoS-as-a-Service platforms, also known as booters or stressers, wield enough attack power to impact most organizations. 
For those with bigger ambitions, like organized crime groups or hackers-for-hire, stresser services typically do not provide the scale, flexibility or Return on investment. They tend to build their own attack tools consisting of botnets and attack infrastructure. Botnets are typically used to generate high packet or request per second attacks that drain the resources of network devices or servers. Attack servers are typically used to perform reflection and amplification attacks. These servers scan for internet services that allow amplification attacks, such as DNS, NTP, SSDP, and Memcached, amongst others. Once amplification server lists are compiled, the attack server will leverage those in uplink saturating volumetric DoS attacks. Do not be mistaken, the internet is full of potential for amplification. Reflection points do not need be large servers. We have observed many attacks leveraging well-known router brands that expose DNS services that allow recursion by default. In 2021, academic researchers published a paper detailing new ways of leveraging forged TCP packets to generate devastating DDoS amplification attacks with amplification factors ranging from 50,000 to 100,000,000s. 
  
How can you protect yourself?  Which defense mechanism is the most effective?  
In our experience, a cloud-based solution is the most effective at stopping all attacks, even those volumetric attacks that are beyond the capacity of the internet links of the protected site. The ultimate solution for businesses that require the lowest latency and best protection is a hybrid DDoS solution. This option combines on-prem detection and prevention, while automatically diverting to a cloud scrubbing center when the attack volumes are threatening to saturate the internet links. 
   
The future of the DDoS Threat Landscape  
As bandwidths of interconnects, clouds and internet connections grow, attacks are becoming larger and more impactful. Our businesses and lives (home automation, online streaming, connected cars) are becoming ever more dependent on internet connectivity. Digitalization accelerated during the pandemic, and that means there is more opportunity to impact businesses and people through DoS attacks. Motivated by the success of past ransomware campaigns, there is a good probability to see an increase in ransom DoS attempts in the near future.   
Figure 1: Total blocked malicious network events in Radware Cloud DDoS Protection Service – 2020 vs 2021 
With a steady growth in blocked malicious events per customer, it does not look like DDoS attacks will disappear anytime soon. With all the vulnerabilities disclosed in the last couple of years the opportunity to build large botnets and abuse more capable amplification services keeps growing. As we digitalize our businesses and our lives by migrating applications to the cloud, creating fully meshed dependencies between online and mobile applications, depending more and more on services and web APIs provided by third parties, connected cars, connected homes, consumption of online video, we start to depend ever more from cloud and connectivity and we make ourselves more vulnerable and create more opportunities for bad people to abuse.  
Motivated by the success of ransomware campaigns, there is high probability to see an increase in Ransom DoS attempts in the near future. My team of researchers are all aligned on a future that will bring more and larger denial of service opportunity and attacks, which is why we are observing very closely the moves, tactics and techniques of malicious actors in the DDoS threat landscape, reporting and sharing our observations and trying to help businesses to protect themselves timely and accurately so bad guys can make little to no impact with their onslaughts. As with most security threats, if you can take away the economy from the threat, attacks and attackers will slowly fade away. But it is very much a perpetual circle that puts us back in every achievement as technology and digitalization of the world continues.

2021 Year in Review: Denial of Service 
2021 was a whirlwind of a year for the security industry. In addition to the still ongoing COVID pandemic, threat actors have continued to evolve at an alarming rate throughout the year, pushing the boundaries of the current landscape to new limits and leaving many wondering if we as an industry can keep up with the growing and ever more resourced criminal complex.  
We saw criminal enforcement and offensive operations launched with minimal success throughout last year. We have also seen threat actors learn from prior mistakes and become less active on major social media platforms.  There were also notable advancements in the Ransom Denial of Service landscape and a growing partnership between Ransomware operators and DDoS operators. And as always, we saw new DDoS records set this year. 
Enforcement in 2021 
This year, when it comes to Denial of Service, law enforcement and offensive-based operations against threat actors have had a minimal impact on the DDoS threat landscape. For example, this year, the Secret Service of Ukraine (SSU) arrested a man for creating and running a botnet with over 100,000 infected nodes. The Dutch Police sent out notification letters to 29 Dutch residence warning that they had been identified as users of a DDoS-for-Hire service. And the United States Department of Justice charged a Turkish national for conducting DDoS attacks via an Android smartphone-based botnet, WireX.   
In general, one would think that police enforcement and offensive-based operations would be enough of a deterrent to slow the rising tide of DDoS operators, but they would be wrong. In Q3 2021, Radware reported that we had mitigated 75% more DDoS attacks in the first nine months of 2021 than in 2020. This was expected though, as our researchers in 2020 noted a rise in DDoS-for-Hire services during the beginning of the pandemic, despite the numerous attempts by law enforcement to prevent the growth of the DDoS threat landscape the year prior.  
At the core, the issue is profit. There is too much money on the table for threat actors to walk away from the DDoS landscape at this point. Today, when a DDoS operator is removed from the threat landscape, other operators simply take their place.  
Staying Below the Radar 
For those not motivated by profit, mainly hacktivists, there have been a few lessons learned from the past as new groups begin to change their procedures in 2021. For example, threat group DragonForce, who carried out several cyber-attacks against Israel in the spring and summer of 2021, has moved away from conventional media platforms and created their forum to conduct their operations. 
This was an interesting shift this year, but one that was expected. At the beginning of 2021, even the criminal underground began experiencing difficulties dealing with brazen ransomware operators and affiliates who openly conducted business on public forums, similar to when hacktivists organized and conducted DDoS campaigns on social media platforms. As a result, threat actors were censored or banned from those malicious forums. 
It seems that hacktivist groups in 2021 are learning how to withdraw from the public eye, self-govern and run their platforms below the radar without fear of being de-hosted. As a result, these lessons learned will make it more difficult for an analyst to track threat actors as conversations move away from one centralized platform to end up on multiple, unknown, specialized forum locations across the internet.

RDoS on the Rise 
At the beginning of 2021, Radware published an alert about a Ransom Denial of Service (RDoS) group circling back to previous victims who were targeted during the summer of 2020. In the new RDoS letters, the group stated that the targeted organizations did not respond to or pay the ransom demand from the original campaign in August of 2020 and subsequently would be targeted by a DDoS attack if they were not paid.  
While this event was notable, it was just the beginning of what would become an impressive year when it came down to RDoS attacks. In June 2021, during a Radware Threat Research Live episode, while discussing the Fake DarkSide campaign targeting the Energy and Food sector, I had predicted that we would soon see RDoS groups leveraging the names of ransomware groups. Three months later, a wave of RDoS attacks began targeting VoIP providers. Specifically, during the attack on VoIP.ms, the threat actors called themselves REvil, a notorious ransomware group that had just returned to the threat landscape after completely disappearing following the Kaseya VSA ransomware attack.  
The greater RDoS campaigns target multiple VoIP providers such as VoIP.ms, Voipfone, VoIP Unlimited, and Bandwidth.com sparked concern as critical infrastructure was impacted, resulting in an industry-wide warning from Comms Council UK, stating that there was currently a “coordinated extortion-focused international campaign by professional cyber criminals” targeting IP-based communication services providers during the month of October. And while generally in the past RDoS attacks have been considered a low tier threat that’s easy to mitigate, one of the victims, Bandwidth.com, is expected to lose up to $12 million following a DDoS extortion attempt they faced as a result of service downtime. Signaling that RDoS threats are evolving.  
A third significant wave of RDoS attacks was also observed at the end of the year, during the same time as the VoIP industry was under attack. This event was an RDoS campaign targeting multiple email providers such as Runbox, Posteo, and Fastmail. One of the more notable observations from this campaign was that the group calling themselves the ‘Cursed Patriarch’ was demanding around $4,000. Similar to the amount requested during the RDoS campaigns that originally targeted email providers back in 2015.  
Going into 2022, I expect the RDoS landscape to continue evolving and eventually merge with the greater ransomware threat landscape. 
Combining Forces; Ransomware + DDoS 
If you are currently sitting there asking yourself, what is the difference between Ransomware and an RDoS attack? Don’t worry. It can get confusing. Luckily, Radware’s Director of Threat Intelligence, Pascal Geenens, recently wrote a blog about the difference between the two.  To recap, Ransomware attacks leverage a crypto-locking malware that destroys systems and makes data inaccessible until a ransom has been paid. An RDoS attack is a bit different. An RDoS attack leverages a Denial of Service attack to cause service degradation or network outages to extort their victims.  
The problem? Ransomware operators are now starting to employ DDoS operators as part of what is now known as triple extortion. A single extortion ransomware attack is just the encryption of data on the targeted device. A double extortion ransomware attack involves the exfiltration of the encrypted data with the threat of publication if a ransom demand is not paid. Triple extortion is when a Ransomware operator uses Denial of Service attacks against the targeted network to bring negotiators back to the table. In 2020 Ransomware operators such as SunCrypt and RagnarLocker used Denial of Service attacks during negotiations. In 2021 we have seen the addition of Avaddon, Darkside, Yanluowang, and HelloKitty using Denial of Service attacks during their ransomware campaigns. 
Botnet Development 
In the world of DDoS botnets, there have been a few significant takedowns and developments across the threat landscape this year. For example, at the beginning of 2021, many IoT researchers intently followed the developments related to a P2P botnet known as Mozi. 360 Netlab was the first to disclose the botnet back in 2019; the botnet had since grown from a small botnet to an advanced, multi-module threat. But in the summer of 2021, 360 Netlab announced that Mozi was dead due to the operator’s arrest in China. While this is great news, most realize how long it will take for this botnet to truly die. While it will no longer receive updates, it will continue spreading for some time because of its architecture and design. Similar to the longtail of the XTC/Hoaxcall botnet, it will likely take years to disappear. Unfortunately, you cannot take something like a P2P botnet down in a single action. The only way this botnet will officially die and disappear is when targeted network devices are all rebooted, updated, or replaced.  
Another botnet that gained significant attention throughout 2021 was the Manga/Dark.IoT botnet. This botnet was also observed by Juniper and Palo Alto Networks throughout the year. The Mange/Dark.IoT botnet revealed nothing extraordinary when analyzed. It’s a typical Mirai-based IoT botnet that sticks to its primary threat vector, DDoS attacks, and does not diversify its operations to mining crypto or data theft. The one thing that stood out to the security industry about this threat was the operator’s ability to quickly evolve and expand their botnets capabilities by incorporating recently disclosed exploits into their arsenal. For example, In March 2021, Unit42 researchers at Palo Alto Networks reported that the operators behind this botnet leveraged CVE-2021-27561 and CVE-2021-27562 within hours of the vulnerability being disclosed. 
The Manga/Dark.IoT campaign this year also provided researchers with several opportunities to explore the trials and errors threat actors face while building and developing a DDoS botnet. One of the most challenging aspects of building a largescale botnet is competing with other threat actors for vulnerable resources. Those that cannot develop or discover exploits rely on public disclosure. Once a PoC is posted, it is a race to be the first to leverage the exploit and gather as many vulnerable devices as possible. This process is trial and error, and some threat actors do not always solve how to properly leverage the vulnerabilities, while those who do might discover the attempt was not worth their time and effort. In 2021 the operators behind the Manga/Dark.IoT botnets have leveraged nearly two dozen exploits. More recently, in December 2021, the botnet was seen targeting TP-Link routers. 
Notable DDoS Attacks 
To be honest, I’m shocked that no one has claimed any of these record-breaking DDoS attacks that I’m about to cover. It wasn’t long ago that hacktivist and DDoS’ers quickly claimed their attacks, or the attacks of others…, on social media. But today, mums seem to be the word with threat actors. We have continuously seen record-breaking DDoS attacks after another this year without a peep from the underground. In some events, Ransomware operators such as Lockbit have taken to underground forums to ask who launched an attack and if their botnet or services were available. With this new silent treatment, it has become increasingly more challenging to track criminal activity, but one thing is clear, the bad guys do have larger DDoS cannons nowadays.  
For example, in August 2021, Cloudflare reported detecting a world record, 17.2Mrps, million requests per second, attack that originated from 20,000 bots based in 125 countries. Less than a month later, Qrator reported detecting a similar record-breaking attack that produced 21.8Mrps from nearly 56,000 MikroTik devices. These massive DDoS attacks only lasted for roughly 60 seconds, leaving many researchers wondering who and what was behind these attacks.  
As early reports have indicated, Meris is believed to be responsible for these two attacks. Meris is reported to be a large-scale IoT botnet that leverages compromised MikroTik routers and HTTP pipelining to launch short but large-scale volumetric DDoS attacks through a network of SOCKS proxies.  
A month after the original Meris attacks, Microsoft reported that they had detected and mitigated a 2.4Tbps, Terabits per second, DDoS attack targeting an Azure customer in Europe. The attack source was said to originate from nearly 70,000 bots from multiple countries in the Asia-Pacific region, similar to the Meris reports. As with the other attacks, this one was also short-lived, with its main burst lasting only 60 seconds.  
While there are still questions remaining about Meris and its origin, these attacks do highlight the growing and ever evolving threat landscape around DDoS attacks. Going into 2022, I predict we will see the progression and evolution of the threat landscape resulting in more significant DDoS attacks as threat actors learn to maximize their bot’s resources and while staying silent about their work. 
Looking Forward 
Looking beyond Meris and all the other advancements this year, we can see going into 2022 that DDoS attacks will never disappear from the threat landscape. While many will discount the threat as trivial or the actors as low-level skids, they will quickly discover in the new year that attacks do not have to be complex to be effective. 
Going forward in 2022, I hope that things begin to normalize for society but in reality, we need to begin preparing for a totally remote and digitally dependent future. To support this future, governments around the world in partnership with the greater security complex, need to find a better way to successfully counter threat actors and learn how to control the threat landscape. Only then will we be able to keep up with a well-resourced enemy.

DDOS Attacks Targeting Payment Services of Global Financial Institutions
A threat actor or group is actively targeting the online services of branches of global financial institutions with their headquarters located in Europe. Radware Cloud DDoS Protection Services prevented multiple attacks from disrupting online web banking, payment validation services and remote access services of branches of financial institutions in several countries across the globe. Over two weeks, Radware observed increased sophistication and refinements to evade detection and mitigation as the attacks progressed. While the targeted financial institutions are headquartered in Europe, Radware witnessed attacks on branches in other continents.
November until January is the global shopping season. It is not uncommon to see an increase in attack activity targeting ecommerce, financial and payment systems—a period where disruption of payment services or web and mobile banking services will not go unnoticed.
Many branches of leading global banks have local services hosted in country. These services include remote access for employees and partners, credit and debit card validation services and online or mobile web banking. In the second half of November, we observed increased activity targeting those services from several global financial institutions in multiple countries. The attacks were initially targeting specific services with volumetric attacks. Attacks subsequently changed to subnet floods, randomizing the destination IP addresses to evade detections. The threat actors persisted and eventually changed their tactics to more challenging and sophisticated encrypted and application-level attacks. Attack durations varied from multivector, hour-long attacks to shorter waves lasting only a few minutes attempting to impact productivity and user experience.
As far as we could verify, there were no ransom letters received by the targeted organizations. While the objective behind the attacks is unclear at this time, it could be one of several, common intents:
gaining a competitive advantage
hacktivists
angry customers
e-fame and trolling
advertising
It is unlikely hacktivism is the motivation behind the attacks. If it was, the attacks would be claimed and mediatized by the hacktivists. An angry customer is also reasonably unlikely given multiple financial institutions and branches in several countries were involved.
Kids looking for e-fame or trolling out of boredom are typically not as persistent and accurate when researching and discovering the most productivity and reputation-impacting targets. They mostly go for the low-hanging fruit and something very noticeable and easy to measure in terms of success, such as a website but not so much remote access services or machine to machine (M2M) APIs.
Skilled hackers demonstrating their capabilities for sale typically advertise in hacking forums, and as far as we could verify, the attacks have not been claimed. That said, the attacks were no success as far as our customers were involved, so there is not much to claim unless they had success with other victims we are not aware of yet.
Not The Technique, Rather Consider The Objective
When record-level attacks make headlines, people tend to lose sight of the objective and merely consider the tactic. Volumetric DDoS attacks reaching beyond 2Tbps get a lot of attention, but these attacks were successfully mitigated and defending against them mostly depends on ones ability to consume vast amounts of traffic. None of those reported massive attacks disrupted services or caused prolonged grievances for their victims.
Recently, several attack campaigns made the news as they impacted services over more extended periods, having their victims believe attacks subsided just to catch them off guard a couple of hours/days later. These impacting attacks were nothing close to terabit per second levels and did not require millions of requests per second to degrade or disrupt the services of their victims.
The objective of a DDoS attack is to degrade or completely disrupt a service in an attempt to impact productivity, reputation or revenue streams of an organization. Behind the objective is a motivation that will differ depending on the threat actor. An angry customer will seek revenge. A competitor would likely want to impact the revenue and productivity to get a competitive advantage and take market share. Organized cybercrime and professional cybercriminals are in it for the money, while skids are looking for e-fame or trolling for fun out of boredom.
With the objective in mind, tools need to be acquired to get to there. This will require investments from the threat actor, either by building or renting an infrastructure, hiring a skilled attacker or taking a subscription with one of the many DDoS-as-a-Service sites.
A threat actor should not bring a canon to a knife fight to be effective. He will want to adapt his capacity and capabilities just enough to overcome any defenses that prevent him to reach his objective. Consider a remote access service that is left unprotected on a 4Gbps internet connection, a simple 5Gbps arbitrary UDP Flood will be adequate to completely disrupt connectivity and boot remote workers of the corporate network.
If, however, that same threat actor notices his 5Gbps flood has little or no impact on the reachability of the service, he will change adapt techniques and attempt to evade defenses. A first step might be randomizing the destination IP addresses within the target’s subnet, also known as Carpet Bombing. Other techniques will require more research,  such as discovering exposed services and targeting them with what resembles legitimate traffic, sometimes adding additional evasions such as encryption to make detection at the network level nearly impossible for most solutions. Ultimately, the attacker will target the service with custom application-level requests. The more attack traffic looks like legitimate requests, the more challenging detection and mitigation will be. Typically such attacks will combine multiple techniques, such as hiding behind vast amounts of anonymizing proxies for application-level requests to resemble traffic originating from legitimate users and further confuse detection to reach the objective of degrading or disrupting the service.
Hitting Where It Hurts
When outages happen or a service is under prolonged attack, customers are (or at least should be) informed and as the issue gets resolved, people regain confidence in the service. If failures are happening randomly, temporary outages keep recurring; customers will start to distrust and question the service.
The pandemic made society more hygiene-aware and seems to have affected people’s preferences for payment by card [1]. The volume of cash used in the UK dropped by up to 60% in 2020. In the US, 28% of people stopped using cash altogether. Online shopping made up 28% of sales in the UK in 2020. Mobile banking, online payments and credit or debit card validation services have become a commodity. Consumers are adapting digital payments at record rates, not realizing the complex infrastructure behind those routine payments. Until a payment fails because a service is offline. We break out in a cold sweat the next few payments, hoping the service will be available this time. November through January are arguably the months most rely on the performance of online payment services.
Work from home is the new normal and remote access has proven adequate to keep a business productive while office spaces are left deserted. But what if employees’ applications freeze several times a day because connectivity was degraded or lost? Trust in the system and productivity will be hurting. Connectivity and VPNs have become the lifeline of many organizations and disrupting or impacting the remote experience of home workers will directly impact the productivity of an organization, not to mention the happiness of the organizations’ employees.
Evolution of Methods and Techniques in Sophisticated Attack Campaigns
Comparing techniques leveraged in the last two weeks during multiple attacks we believe are related to the same threat actors or group (see “DDoS Attack Attribution is Hard”), we observed a stepped increase in sophistication and refinement as campaigns progressed and attacks kept being successfully mitigated. The attacks were randomly distributed across countries, branches and organizations, but techniques seemed to morph in unison.
Please note that all attacks discussed below were successfully mitigated with minimal impact on the targeted services.
In the second half of November, a branch of a global financial institution got targeted by several volumetric DDoS attacks. The attacks consisted of multiple 3-minute waves and spread over a period of three hours and one wave later in the day. The attack traffic across all waves consisted primarily of UDP Fragment Floods and DNS amplification. The amplification attacks originated from close to 5,000 unique source IP addresses and peaked at 17Gbps and 1.6Mpps (million packets per second). The Floods were targeting a specific IP address from a server hosting online debit and credit card validation services.

This attack came only two days after a short, 5-minute attack of 12.5Gbps that targeted a branch in a different country. The attack vectors consisted of UDP Fragment, DNS amplification and several types of HTTPS TCP floods and HTTPS connection attempts and originated from more than 6,000 unique source IPs.

In the meantime, we started seeing more similar attack patterns across other financial institutions and countries. Below is an attack consisting of three subsequent traffic bursts. The first two bursts and part of the third burst targeted a credit and debit card validation server, while the most significant part of the third wave was directed at 240 IP addresses within the /24 subnet of the branch.

The traffic directed at the online card validation services consisted primarily of UDP Fragment and DNS Amplification Floods to random destination ports. The traffic directed at the subnet leveraged DNS amplification to 240 different IP addresses with a fixed destination port 80. Traffic across the three waves originated from 4,000 unique source IP addresses, the same addresses observed between attack waves.
One day after the previous attack, another branch was targeted by an attack that lasted one hour during office hours. The attack consisted of several widely spread bursts of 2 to 3 minutes each. All bursts leveraged attack vectors consisting primarily of volumetric attacks leveraging DNS Amplification Floods destined to port 80 and UDP Fragment Floods. Attacks were targeted at a subnet rather than a specific server or service.

The peak attack sizes were not exceptionally large, topping off below 6Gbps. However, remember the expression I used earlier: do not bring a canon to a knife fight. Not every organization or branch equips multi-gigabit per second internet connections. If the objective is to temporarily perturb the user experience on connections to local branches that had to accommodate increasing amounts of remote workers only requires part of the capacity to saturate the line or slow down communications.
A few days later, the same assets were targeted by a 9-minute attack peaking just above 10Gbps. The attack traffic, this time, consisted of UDP Fragments, NTP and LDAP amplifications, and ICMP Floods.

This brings me to another related attack that showed the actors targeting remote access services. One of the financial institutions’ branches had three specific servers targeted by a very distinctive traffic pattern. Almost to the point of being a textbook example of testing attack services, if not, this is a live production network of an organization rather than one of the many (illegal) DStat services such as dstat.cc attackers leverage to evaluate their DDoS capabilities.

The attack lasted 48 minutes in total and consisted of four, 12-minute waves with equal parts of attack traffic divided between TCP, UDP and ICMP Floods. The first wave combined the three attack vectors, while subsequent waves ran single attack vectors.
Attack traffic was also equally spread over the three targeted IP addresses. One of the IP addresses resolved to a hostname that started with ‘api’, another with ’vpn’, and the third hostname started with ’partner’. As the IP addresses revealed the function of the service, the threat actors revealed some of their objectives in targeting APIs, VPNs and online applications, a partner portal in this particular case.

The source IP addresses of the attack traffic consisted of 1,138 different addresses, all taken from a single autonomous system belonging to an internet service provider in Poland.

It’s fair to assume that the attacker spoofed the source IP addresses. These attacks most certainly originated from a server infrastructure. It is impossible to keep bandwidths and packets per second as consistent and evenly spread across servers while leveraging amplification and reflection assaults. ICMP Floods, in particular, have varying success when reflecting from third-party servers. While this attack had several tangents with the other discussed attacks, I must admit that this attack is only loosely related. But it came as such a surprise that I could not withhold from sharing it.
The most recent observed attack, in December, targeted card validation services of a branch outside of Europe of yet another global financial institution with headquarters in Europe. The attack lasted about 5-minutes and was peaking at 14Gbps and 3Mpps. The attack traffic combined volumetric and resource starvation attack vectors. The volumetric vectors were leveraging UDP Fragments, DNS Amplification and LDAP Amplification. The resource starvation attacks vectors consisted primarily of 1.6Mpps HTTPS TCP Floods and connection attempts originating from over 12,000 unique source IP addresses and a 100Kpps ICMP BlackNurse attack [2] flood.

It is when attacks get sophisticated and make distinguishing legitimate from attack traffic more difficult. Even if application level requests require a TCP session to be established, forcing the attacker’s hand at revealing their infrastructure’s IP addresses, besides using botnets attackers still have the option to leverage large networks of (illegal) SOCKS proxies and hide their source IP address behind multiple proxies [3]. SOCKS proxy lists can be bought through underground forums and some leverage infected routers, allowing criminals to hide attacks behind legitimate users’ IP addresses while conducting application-level DDoS attacks.
DDoS Attack Attribution is Hard
Attack attribution is hard, even more so for DDoS attacks. Many DDoS attack techniques leverage spoofing and reflection, making it impossible to trace the origin of the traffic. To make matters harder, amplification and reflection resources for DNS, NTP, LDAP, ARMS, SSDP, etc. are readily available and abused by many making correlation of attacks and attribution to common threat actors or groups less reliable. Only when threat actors brag about their exploits on social networks or when DDoS-as-a-service providers see their attack and billing logs leaked can one close in on attribution of DDoS attacks.
In the attacks on global financial institutions, we made the assumption that the attacks were performed by one and the same threat actor or group. We observe a lot of random attack activity, but the attacks referred to in this blog were all correlating through similar targeted services across multiple organizations within the same vertical and recurring attacks targeting the exact same IP address with attack characteristics that were identical within margins of error.
Your Defense Strategy Should Depend on the Exposed Assets and Services
In most cases, I’m not worried about the most visible parts of attack traffic graphs. Large and consistent floods are easily detected and mitigated. However, more worrying are the potentially malicious traffic patterns on the bottom of the barrel. Application-layer attacks require much less bandwidth compared to volumetric attacks to be effective and they are as easy to perform given access to illegal proxy lists. Publicly available attack tools that leverage proxy services can send large amounts of HTTP GET requests or perform HTTP POST requests with randomized information that requires application side logic and validation to detect the request’s legitimacy. That is why protections need to be adapted to the exposed assets and services being protected.
Protecting a network against saturation-level volumetric DDoS attacks requires cloud protection solutions that have enough capacity to consume even the largest of known attacks and clean the traffic before it gets routed back to the protected network. Stateless, network-layer protection solutions are adequate to protect network devices and servers against resource starvation attacks on-premise.
When exposing online applications users interact with, both the network and the application layer should be protected. Such a solution should be able to make the distinction between humans and machines (bots) and between good and bad bots. Protecting online APIs or single page mobile applications is different from protecting web applications. Consumers of APIs are mostly devices or machines, so distinguishing between humans and machines is not relevant and more advanced detection mechanisms will be required.

Ransomware & Ransom DoS, Why They Are Similar But Different
Since 2020, ransomware and ransom denial-of-service (RDoS) have become ubiquitous with ransomware attacks grabbing headlines nearly every week. While ransomware and ransom DoS have a common objective and some of their tactics overlap, their techniques and success rate are quite different, and so is the threat and potential impact for organizations. Over time, as both threats evolved, they have been cross-leveraging reputation and techniques.  
Ransomware  
Ransomware attacks leverage a crypto-locking malware that destroys systems and makes data inaccessible. Crypto-locking malware needs to be deployed on servers inside the organization. Attackers need to breach the network or a device inside the network and then move laterally across the organization to impact as many systems and lock as much data as possible. Initial access is typically provided by Initial Access Brokers, the middlemen who use their own methods to breach and gain a foothold in networks and then sell that access to other threat actors, mostly ransomware gangs or their affiliates. 
Ransomware attacks render systems inoperable and data inaccessible. In many cases, sensitive data is extracted with a potential risk of data leaks.  
Ransom DoS 
RDoS attackers leverage denial-of-service attacks to extort their victims. By disrupting online services, they can impact the business, productivity and reputation of an organization. Attackers target online resources such as websites, domain name services, web APIs, gaming lobbies, etc. to render online services inoperable and impact an organization’s reputation. They can also impact the productivity of organizations by targeting voice, email and remote access in branch offices or from remote workers. Other targets include internet connectivity required to access cloud applications, production plants that depend on connectivity for remote operations and the cloud for logistic data exchange with resource planning applications and external organizations. 
It is important to note, unlike Ransomware attacks, RDoS and DDoS attacks in general do not breach networks or systems. No data is stolen or compromised during the attacks.  
An RDoS attack starts with the attacker sending a private message, for example by email using a privacy-minded email provider, asking for payment of a certain ransom amount to prevent an organization becoming the target of their next attack. If an organization decides not pay within a set deadline, the attackers will start a DDoS attack and continue until the ransom is paid. Typically, the ransom demand increases every day the victim refuses to pay.  
In reality, DDoS attacks tend to disappear as soon as the actor finds their attempts being successfully mitigated. They last for several hours, change vectors trying to evade the detection and mitigation systems, might spur up again several days after failed attempts, but ultimately the extortionists are forced to walk away empty-handed.

Ransomware Tripple Extortion 
Techniques leveraged by Ransomware operators have evolved and diversified to increase the potential to reach their objective. As victims got better prepared and backups readily available to restore and recover from crypto-locking malware, Ransomware operators started exfiltrating sensitive data that would give them more leverage over the victim. If the victim still was not impressed, operators started threatening with DDoS attacks and pressured their victims into coming back to the negotiation table. 
Ransom DoS actors posing as Ransomware gangs 
The success, impact and drama surrounding highly visible ransomware gangs has not escaped the attention of other criminals. In one of the recent RDoS campaigns targeting VoIP providers in UK and Canada, actors posed as ‘REvil,’ an infamous ransomware gang responsible for the devastating attacks on JBS SA and Kaseya Ltd. Similar to ransomware operators announcing new victims on underground blogs, the RDoS actors posing as ‘REvil’ shared their ransom letter through Pastebin and extorted one of their victims, Voip.ms, in public on Twitter, aiming to increase the pressure on the victim.

Defending against Ransomware and Ransom DoS 
Speaking from personal experience, I have yet to see a DDoS attack that blasts through our defenses. That said, there is always a small window of time where bad traffic can potentially leak while detection algorithms are crafting automated signatures to block bad traffic and tune the signatures to avoid false positives that would block legitimate traffic. But in general, there is, in my experience, no reason to pay the ransom when protected by an adequate DDoS service.  
Ransomware, on the other hand, is a very hard threat to defend against and eliminate. Ransomware operators have been organizing their underground ecosystems and gathered a lot of following from skilled hackers-for-hire and affiliates that are happy to share the profits from large extortion campaigns. The incentive has become too big, and the demand for hacking skills and resources on the underground has been growing ever since ransomware operators have had successful campaigns. With highly motivated threat actors looking for payments from organized cybercrime groups, attacks have shifted from automated to human operated attacks. It is one thing to defend against automation, but far more difficult to defend against human intelligence and perseverance driven by multi-million-dollar payouts.

Does Your DDoS Protection Solution Defend Against the Latest Attacks? 
Last year 86% of enterprises were impacted by a DDoS attack (Radware annual security report).  This means 86% of businesses suffered outages that at a minimum impacted their employees and as a worst case, impacted their customer experience and revenue.  There’s no room for mistakes when choosing your security technology and approach. Enterprises need to ensure that the selected vendor is capable of defending its network and applications from the latest DDoS burst and multi-vector attacks. 
What happens to businesses without the right protection?    
Here’s an example.  An APAC bank became the latest target of a DDoS attack campaign which began in early September.  The attacks initially impacted the bank’s primary service provider.  Although the bank deployed Akamai’s Cloud DDoS protection service a few days before the attack, this service was not able to identify and mitigate all bad traffic.    Bad traffic “leaked” from the Akamai solution, impacting the bank’s Checkpoint Firewalls, causing additional service outages.  Unfortunately for the bank, these outages captured public attention. 
The bank’s IT team initially thought they could handle the DDoS attacks with their existing solutions.  However, after more unsuccessful mitigation attempts including damaging news stories, the bank’s management called a meeting between their IT team, Cisco and Radware to architect a solution. 
SOLUTION 
The team recommended Radware’s on-premise DDoS device to provide enhanced protection from the latest attack vectors which the Akamai service couldn’t handle.   
In mid-September the first appliance was deployed inline, initially in Report mode.  Ten days later, the bank IT team needed  assistance with a large volumetric UDP/TCP flood attack, with burst characteristics, against its VPN.  The Akamai Cloud DDoS solution handled up to 100 Gbps of the attack but “leaked” another 2-2.5 Gbps of bad traffic, causing remote connectivity issues and disruption to their banking operations.  The attack traffic leaks continued until Akamai initiated blacklists for the bad traffic. 
Figure 1. Attack traffic leaks from Akamai Cloud DDoS solution halted by blacklisting 
[You may also like: Smart DDoS Protection During the COVID-19 Crisis]
The DDoS protection appliance in Report mode immediately identified attack vectors the Akamai service was not able to identify and mitigate, including UDP FRAG and ICMP/UDP/DNS reflection attacks. Radware’s DDoS solution offers protection against advanced DDoS attacks, including Burst attacks, low and slow attacks, UDP fragmentation and SYN Floods, that cloud scrubbing services are unable to provide.  Cloud services, by definition, look only at inbound (ingress) traffic; they are unable to protect against attack vectors which require two-way visibility into traffic.  
Once the Radware team performed a thorough traffic analysis to ensure there were no false positives and moved policies from Report to Block Mode, the bank was fully protected. The bank appreciated Radware’s technology to identify and defend against attacks . Since the incident, Radware’s DDoS protection appliance has been installed in all of the bank’s data centers. The bank has not suffered any additional outages and now enjoys the benefits of Radware’s DDoS protection. 
For additional information, see the bank case study here.
Questions to Ask In Order to Evaluate Security Vendor Capabilities 
When evaluating security solutions, make sure to ask vendor whose products you’re evaluating the following questions:  
1.Can you ensure business continuity under attack? 
2.What attacks does your solution defend against? 
3.Do you use behavioral learning algorithms to establish ‘legitimate’ traffic patterns? 
4.How do you distinguish between good and bad traffic?

Q3 Quarterly Report of DDoS and Application Attacks
Results about cyberattack activity from Q3 are in and right off the bat we noticed more DDoS attacks were blocked during first nine months of 2021 than all of 2020. During the third quarter, DDoS records for large volumetric attacks were broken across three continents. At the same time, phantom floods, or micro attacks that typically fly below radar, increased. 
The reality is organizations need more granular detection and multi-layer defenses to protect against today’s stealthier and more complex DDoS attacks. Something important to note is a single quarter is not an indicator of a trend. The data from the full report analyzes DDoS attacks, network and application attack activity sourced from Radware’s cloud and managed services and Radware’s Global Deception Network and what we’ll lightly touch on in this post. 
DDoS Attacks
The most attacked industry in the third quarter was technology, with an average of 2,638 attacks per company, followed by healthcare (1,785 attacks per company), communications (1,525 attacks per company) and finance (1,337 attacks per company). Although the total number of events for the third quarter was slightly below previous quarters in 2021, the number stayed above the highest quarterly level recorded in 2020. To take it a step further the total volume blocked in the first three quarters of 2021 was 44% higher than the same period in 2020.
So why did we see a dip in Q3? The attackers changed their tactics from saturation-based floods to server resource–consuming, application-level attacks.
Q3 was not without its share of record DDoS attacks, in September a threat actor known as ReVil wreaked havoc on Service Providers in the UK and Canada with colossal high ransom demands.
Web Application Attacks Doubled
Banking and finance were hit the hardest and accounted for almost 23% of all blocked web application security events. To break it down further Government (16%), technology (15%) and retail (12%) were among the most attacked industries.
 Web application attacks doubled every quarter this year; predictable resource location was witnessed twice as often as SQL injection followed by code injection attacks and cross-site scripting attacks. 
Unsolicited Network Scanning and Attack Activity Surges 
Network scanning and attack activity was marked by opportunistic and random scanning that constitutes a large part of the vulnerability and exploit threat landscape. Malicious actors continuously leverage old and freshly disclosed vulnerabilities such as remote command execution and command injection exploits that are easy to integrate into existing malware and exploit tools. Along with the evolution in cloud resources and services, there is no more hiding on the internet. Every deep corner of the internet gets inventoried in convenient IoT search engines.
In Q3, unsolicited scanning activity peaked at 27 million events per day, representing the second highest level during 2021. The most scanned and attacked TCP services are SSH followed by VNC and RDP.
To Sum it All Up
Attacks did not regress, and overall volumes were not great. This can be partly explained by the shift to more insidious and application-level attacks. For their ransom campaigns, actors favored targets that were not immune to their assaults. Does this mean they’re becoming more selective? Radware raised this point earlier in the year, when it reported ransom DoS attacks on targets that were not protected by always-on cloud solutions. The record large-scale DDoS attacks were hit-and-run assaults. These might have been tests of capability or probing the protections of certain providers, or even a demonstration of capabilities and a precursor of what is yet to come. Chatter on underground forums and theories being discussed by the media do not provide a clear understanding of the objectives and tools leveraged by the actors behind those colossal assaults.
Regarding web application attacks, the number of blocked web application security events has doubled almost every quarter this year. Q3 accounts for 2.1 million blocked application security events per customer, or an average of 700,000 blocked security events per month per customer. Almost half of the web application attacks were predictable resource location attacks. The second top security violation blocked by our web application security services was SQL injection attacks, followed by code injection attacks and cross-site scripting attacks. The top violations reported in Q3 are aligned with the top web application security risks published by the OWASP Foundation in their 2017 and 2021 OWASP Top 10 lists.
Finally, network scanning and attack activity was marked by opportunistic and random scanning that constitutes a large part of the vulnerability and exploit threat landscape. Malicious actors continuously leverage old and freshly disclosed vulnerabilities such as remote command execution and command injection exploits that are easy to integrate into existing malware and exploit tools. The objectives behind the attack activity are governed by cryptojacking, discovery of amplification and reflection services for volumetric DDoS attacks, acquiring a foothold to perform lateral movement and privilege escalation and ultimately drop backdoors or ransomware. They are also able to abuse services and devices as jump hosts or anonymous proxy and port forwarders for targeted attacks

A Three-Episode DDoS Ransom Attack Prologue
DDoS attacks are becoming a part of ransom attacks. Instead of infiltrating secure organizational assets, attackers are launching devastating DDoS attacks to demonstrate their capabilities and demand ransom money. Understanding the ransom DDoS threat is essential to building an effective mitigation plan.
Our story begins in August of 2020, and continues for over a year with three episodes. Here they are:
Episode I
In August 2020, we witnessed the first wave of cyber extortion attacks, where the ‘Lazarus group’ was targeting finance, travel and e-commerce organizations by sending them a ransom email, requesting companies to pay 10 bitcoins (which was about $100,000). A few hours after receiving the message, organizations were hit by DDoS attacks exceeding 200Gbps lasting over nine hours, causing severe service disruption.
In their letters (see below), the extortionists gave their victims seven days to buy the bitcoin and pay the ransom before deploying their DDoS attacks.  However every day of delay increased the ransom by 1 bitcoin.
Episode II
In January 2021 we saw a second extortion wave. The cyber criminals sent new extortion emails stating, “Maybe you forgot us, but we didn’t forget you. We were busy working on more profitable projects, but now we are back.” This time they asked for 5 bitcoin, (Bitcoin value exceeded $30,000).
The lesson is clear, do not pay the ransom! If you do pay, you will be targeted again and again… and so it continues.
Episode III
Starting June 2021, a new wave of cyber extortion campaigns began targeting all sectors, starting with Danish and Irish ISPs and CSPs. The group modified its name to ‘Fancy Lazarus’. The ransom was much smaller and varying by victim between ₿0.5 (US$18,500), ₿2 (US$75,000) and ₿5 (US$185,000) – they adapted the ransom demand to the company size – subsequent attacks were up to 200Gbps.
As DDoS attacks have evolved, we have seen new tactics where the attackers were hunting for unprotected assets, including public cloud assets, attacking DNS services and saturating links. This  demonstrates that the attackers were getting ready in advance by learning their victims’ weak spots.
Reports from victims impacted by follow-through attacks of this extortion campaign confirm that most were relying on their ISP or CSP to defend against DDoS threats. However, they were not prepared for large scale DDoS attacks with varying attack vectors including application DDoS attacks.


- https://www.radware.com/blog/ddos-protection/2021/07/an-overview-of-ddos-attacks-in-q2-of-2021/
An Overview of DDoS Attacks in Q2 of 2021
Unsurprisingly gaming and telecommunication industries experienced the largest attack volumes in Q2. We saw a rise in burst attacks and were introduced to new threat actors and hacktivist groups rising from the shadows. The bottom line is cybercriminals are becoming more brazen in their attacks and ransoms. No industry is immune to a cyberattack but what is certain is if your applications and networks are unprotected, they will work relentlessly to disrupt access and intentionally cause significant damage to your organization’s reputation.
Methods Attackers Used to Disrupt Access to your Networks and Applications
The objective of volumetric attacks is to saturate the internet links; on average, 90% of the attack volume targeted HTTP or HTTPS (see Figure Below)! Even if an organization does not expose HTTP(S) services, volumetric assaults can overrun internet pipes and network equipment.

UDP is still the most leveraged protocol when it comes to volume for DDoS attacks, which is not surprising considering UDP traffic can be easily spoofed and most of the amplification attack vectors are UDP-based.
DDoS Attacks Used By Attackers
Bursts attacks, also known as hit-and-run DDoS, use repeated short bursts of high-volume attacks at regular intervals. Each short burst can last only a few minutes, while a burst attack campaign can span hours or even days. Throughout Q2 of 2021, Radware observed several burst attacks in attack size and frequency aimed at customers in the finance and tech industries.
RDoS Campaigns
Gaining popularity in the news are ransom denial of service (RDoS) attacks. In short, this is when an organization receives a notice with demands to pay a ransom or else become the target of a ferocious DDoS attack rendering their network and service availability useless and nonexistent. For example, a threat actor posing as ‘Fancy Lazarus’ demanded a payout between 0.5 and 5 bitcoins to prevent a DDoS attack against a victim’s network assets. In early May, several internet service providers (ISPs) in Scandinavia, Western Europe, and Ireland reported receiving ransom letters followed by DDoS attacks. By the end of May, Radware had numerous emergency onboardings of its cloud security services from organizations that had received these ransom letters.

Hacktivism
Where there is political unrest, chances are you find a hacktivist operation. DragonForce Malaysia (a pro-Palestinian hacktivist group in Malaysia) targeted the Middle east in mid-June, during an operation named #OpsBedil, with a series of attacks, including DDoS attacks

Government Faces Massive DDoS Attacks Following Protests

Earlier this year, in a country populated with over 50 million people, a series of protests began due to higher taxes, corruption and a healthcare reform proposed by the government. Although the government authorities had anticipated the protests would be widespread, no one suspected that a massive DDoS attack would be launched on multiple assets of the government’s networks with the intent of bringing it down. Shortly after the attack began, a notorious group of hackers came forward and claimed responsibility for the three-wave attack lasting two weeks.
First Wave of Attacks: Hit by Surprise
The first wave of the attack came as a surprise to the government. The wave hit 9Gbps in only 30 seconds using highly sophisticated vectors. (see fig. 1)

The government has been a Radware client for over eight years and had multiple Radware DefensePro devices installed on-premise in all of its data centers. The devices were properly functioning and successfully mitigated several attacks in the past, but the government had no idea when the attack would dissipate and the maximum volume it would reach.  In parallel to the ongoing on-premise mitigation, they immediately reached out to Radware’s ERT (Emergency Response Team) to get additional assistance and ensuring their company was safeguarded. The ERT proposed an emergency onboarding of Radware’s Cloud DDoS Protection Service in an Always-On mode to be completely covered. Two hours later all government traffic was diverted to one of Radware’s 14 global scrubbing centers. The traffic was diverted in an always-on mode, meaning all network traffic is constantly inspected and scrubbed before continuing to the destination data center.

Unsuccessful Mitigation by Local ISP
In parallel to contacting Radware’s ERT, the government decided to contact their local ISPs, requesting them to start blocking some of the attack traffic on their end before it would reach the government’s data centers. The two ISPs (leveraged DDoS mitigation solutions fromNetscout and Corero) agreed to assist but unfortunately could not mitigate the attack traffic before it reached the Radware devices in a matter of the seconds the traffic was cleaned and there was no impact on the network.
Government Fully Prepared for Next Waves of Attacks
Less than 10 hours later, the second wave assault began (see Figure. 2). This time, five minutes into the attack, the volume reached 135Gbps. As all of the traffic was already diverted to Radware’s cloud scrubbing center, the government had no impact whatsoever on its network. This repeated itself during the third wave, which started a few days later.
Figure 2

You Can Never Be Over Prepared
After eight years of being a Radware client leveraging on-premise devices, the government now has a hybrid deployment covering all its assets. The solution combines on-premise attack mitigation with a cloud scrubbing service available on-demand to mitigate volumetric attacks that aim to saturate the internet pipe. The two mitigation methods work in perfect harmony, with innovative messaging technology that runs the communication between the appliance and the cloud service. If there is one thing to learn from what happened to this government’s network, it is better to be safe than sorry.


- https://www.radware.com/blog/ddos-protection/2021/06/ddos-attacks-against-financial-institutes-resurge-in-june-2021/
DDoS Attacks Against Financial Institutes Resurge in June 2021
According to the latest report published by Radware’s Threat Research team, Q1 of 2021 saw an increase in volume of DDoS attacks by 30%. Beyond the sheer volume, technology evolution brings new means of DDoS attacks. The attack techniques are becoming more sophisticated, and the volumes increase. For cyber attackers, no business is too big or too small.
Over the last month, there has been a wave of attacks targeting specifically financial institutes all around the globe. One of the latest victims was a global European bank that was targeted by a multi-vector attack.
The bank, ranked as one of the top 15 banks in Europe, with over a trillion dollars in assets, has data centers all over the globe. During the second week of June 2021, it became a victim of three large bursts of traffic, which repeated persistently. This attack has reached over 200 gigabytes of volume in total (see Fig. 1)
Fig. 1: recurring bursts
The first attack started around the evening and peaked at 80 Gbps within seconds (see Fig. 2). As the attack began, Radware’s ERT team immediately got involved to ensure complete and immediate mitigation.
Fig. 2: the first attack peaking at over 80 Gbps
An hour later, the attackers launched the second and third attacks that followed. This wave of attacks peaked at 45 Gbps and 24 Gbps (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).
Fig. 3: The second attack peaking at over 45 Gbps
Fig. 4: The third attack peaking at over 24 Gbps
The Attack Vectors and the Radware Defense
All three attacks were multi-vector attacks, including the following:
1.Network flood ipv4 UDP-FRAG
2.Network flood ipv4 UDP
3.DOSS-tcp-zero-seq
4.Network flood ipv4 ICMP
5.DOSS-ip-proto-oddness
6.ICMP-BlackNurse-Attack
7.TCP handshake violation. First packet not SYN
8.DOSS-IP-GGP-Protocol-Flood
9.DOSS-DNS-Ref-L4-Above-3000
10.Memcached-Server-Reflected

Amplification DDoS Attacks Using Exposed MemCached Servers
The last vector targets MemCached servers which are used for internal purposes and not meant to be exposed to the internet. When exposed, they can be exploited to launch amplified attacks potentially overwhelming a victim’s resources. Such exploit was used to launch the massive DDoS attack on GitHub in 2018. The fact that the servers do not have native authentication made it easier to launch amplified attacks against the victims
When the attack on the bank started, Radware’s behavioral detection technology immediately kicked in. It allows the analysis of the traffic and differentiates between legitimate and malicious traffic accurately. As a result, it took only seconds to generate signatures to block the attack. In parallel, all traffic containing anomalies, such as packets with invalid IP header length or port value set to zero, was automatically blocked.
All the bank’s data centers are protected by Radware’s always–on cloud services. All traffic is constantly diverted to one of Radware’s 14 scrubbing centers globally in such a setup. After the traffic is scrubbed and clean, it continues to its original destination.

Mitigated, As If It Never Happened
When under such types of attacks, on the bank’s side, one thing is crucial: protecting the SLA and user experience by ensuring absolutely no impact on the network.
While such a persistent and high-volume attack unfolded on the bank, no impact whatsoever was caused to the network. All legitimate users trying to access the network during the attack could do so, and no outages were reported even for one second.
How to Choose the Right Security Vendor
Last year 86% of enterprises were affected by a DDoS attack (Radware annual security report); now more than ever, there’s no room for mistakes when choosing the security technology and approach. Enterprises should make sure that the selected vendor is indeed capable of defending its network from bursts and multi-vector attacks becoming so current.
Top Three Questions to ask your vendor?
Can the vendor ensure business continuity under attack?
How much time into the attack will a contact from the emergency response team be available for support?
What happens if the volume increases a certain threshold?
Organizations should make sure they are prepared now, to not find out otherwise under the worst circumstances.

Behavioral Analytics: How to Secure User Experience under a DDoS Attack
Imagine the following scenario. Following the Covid-19 outbreak, a local government website became the reliable central hub to communicate governmental information to its citizens. The information might vary from instructions for making an appointment to get vaccinated while under lockdown. One evening, on the nine o’clock news, the news anchor states that thousands of vaccines have just become available. All citizens should access their local government website to get more information. At the same time, a group of hacktivists DDoS attackers protesting against the way the government handles this health crisis decides to launch an attack on the server that will take down the website.
The next generation of cyber attackers
Today’s cyber-attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their never-ending quest for new ways to launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to compromise service availability, take down networks, servers, and websites. While their motives vary, their pertinence is consistent.
Rate limiting is not the best approach
In front of such an adversary, the need to be one step ahead grows daily. The scale and diversity of recent DDoS attacks have reached levels that no one would have imagined possible.
With that said, it is surprising to see that most DDoS attack mitigation solutions are primarily utilizing rate-limiting techniques. In other words, all traffic exceeding a certain volume threshold will be blocked without distinguishing if malicious or not, resulting in some legitimate users being unable to get service. By doing so, many organizations sacrifice the user experience and productivity while under a DDoS attack.

Legitimate users should not be affected during a cyberattack
Legitimate users do not see (and don’t care about) the entire picture. They are not informed that the server is severely attacked and cannot deliver service to him at the moment. They only see one thing—they needed a service and were denied access to it.
Today, organizations no longer accept false positives resulting in blocking real users. Just like they don’t accept it under peacetime, they shouldn’t under an attack. Even in low volumes, they should not accept malicious traffic that reaches the server.
More sophisticated technology is required to ensure the customer experience even during significant attacks.
[Click for Full Report: Quarterly Threat Intelligence Report]
Behavioral analysis is the new standard
The behavioral approach is starting to expand as more vendors understand that this is becoming the new standard for DDoS mitigation. Organizations committed to protect their assets and ensure constant service availability for their users will not settle for less.
Let’s go back to our government website scenario. It is now nine o’clock, numerous citizens are trying to access the website, but the massive DDoS attack has taken it down.
An advanced and sophisticated behavioral DDoS mitigation tool can block the attack the hackers are trying to launch on the site and allow citizens continued access.  Blocking a suspicious IP address or a specific malicious origin is not the only thing behavioral analysis does; it also analyzes the motives behind each request and does not rely solely on the amount of traffic at a specific time. The site might be under a massive attack; however, at the same time, a flash crowd of citizens wanting to get vaccinated need access to the site. Distinguishing between the two is the entire concept of behavioral-based DDoS mitigation.
The business enterprise’s objective is to secure the user experience by assuring availability. We should not let the fear of massive DDoS attacks be a catalyst for choosing methods that block legitimate users and affects their experience but instead push the solution to be smarter.

An Overview of DDoS Attacks in Q1
Cyber-extortionists are no joke; last year, a hefty ransom DDoS attack aimed at the finance industry was deployed. These cybercriminals circled back to earlier victims who did not pay at an even more aggressive rate than their first collection attempt, which ended up lasting through the first half of Q1 of 2021. Other industries like biotechnology and pharmaceutical experienced steady waves of minor attacks targeted at their operations, which was very similar to what they experienced in Q4 of 2020.
To overcome the pandemic, organizations began relying on remote operations, teleworking and remote access infrastructure. As a result, DDoS actors found new opportunities and began targeting the backend of the communication infrastructure of organizations. Several global organizations had branches/remote offices impacted during this period, with actors leveraging new tactics to impact organizational productivity by targeting internet connectivity and remote access. With limited bandwidth, attackers achieved more impact and disrupted organization’s operations.
Q4 Vs. Q1: Monthly Volume of DDoS Attacks
The total number of attacks in Q1 decreased compared to Q4. However, it’s not because of a lack of trying. The total attack volume sharply rose. Upon further study, the average attack size in Q1 of 2021 was down from over 315Mbps in December to levels just below 150Mbps. In March of 2021, one in every 1,000 attacks was greater than 10Gbps compared to three per 1,000 attacks in December of 2020.
[Click for Full Report: Quarterly Threat Intelligence Report]
DDoS Attacks by Industry
Activity in the healthcare industry shifted to a smaller number of attacks targeting hospitals towards the end of Q1, but biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries were attacked more intensely for their public assets.
In contrast, the government sector experienced a lower number of attacks but higher volumes towards the end of Q1, vastly different from what it experienced in Q4 with high numbers of low-volume assaults.
Upon dissecting attacks on the finance industry, attacks changed from infrequent, high-volume attacks in Q4 to smaller, more frequent global attacks in March, impacting more offices and branches of multinational organizations.
What They Targeted: On-Premise vs. Cloud Mitigated
This year in Q1, more than 85% of attacks were mitigated on-premise. When attack volumes are close to the saturation level of the internet connection, on-premise devices will divert to the cloud. On-premise devices, detection and mitigation will fail to prevent 15% of the attacks. If latency introduced by cloud protection is essential, 85% of the attacks can be mitigated by on-premise equipment. Intrusions made up 73% of all malicious events with the majority mitigated on-premise. The cloud scrubbing centers are responsible for mitigating 94% of DoS events.
The Affect Time of Day Had on DDoS Attacks
In Q4, the government was the most attacked industry. Towards the end of Q1, it was superseded by the finance industry.
There is a distinctive pattern in reference to timing. The highest concentration of attacks occurred during business hours Monday thru Friday. Very few attacks were recorded during the holidays. Also, it is important to note the number of attacks initiated at night is lower than the number of attacks deployed during office hours and is consistent across time zones.

DNS Security, A Never-Ending Story
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the essential Internet phone book, mapping human-readable host names into machine-readable IP addresses. Without DNS, the Internet cannot function. When their DNS service is degraded or stopped, online businesses are disrupted, they lose revenue, and their reputation is on the line.
The tremendous impact of DNS attacks was evident in October 2016, when a Mirai DDoS attack targeted DynDNS and took down Twitter, Reddit, Spotify, Github and many other popular internet services in the US for hours.
The DDoS attack against Amazon Web Services (AWS)’s Route 53 in October 2019 denied customers from accessing AWS hosted services for eight hours.
Why is DNS So Attractive for Attackers?
Attackers have developed techniques that exploit the DNS’ hierarchical infrastructure weaknesses and protocol vulnerabilities for mounting attacks against DNS services, targeting either recursive resolvers or authoritative servers. But what makes DNS such an attractive attack vector?
[You may also like: The Top Web Service Exploits in 2020]
1. DNS is Open to Everyone
The DNS infrastructure must be open and accessible to anyone to keep the internet functioning. Private networks need to allow at least outbound DNS communication to enable internet services for its users. That provides open access for everyone, including attackers. Tunneling techniques can be used by attackers to encapsulate data within the DNS protocol for various purposes such as exfiltration of confidential data or covert messaging with Command-and-Control servers.
2. The Amplification Effect
DNS queries typically return relatively small responses. However, a specially crafted DNS request can return a response that is between 50 to 100 times the size of the request. Attackers use this DNS feature to amplify DDoS attacks and achieve higher attack volumes.
3. Reflection and DNS Spoofing
DNS is a stateless protocol that largely relies on UDP to ensure scalable and fast operation. This makes DNS very attractive for attackers who can easily hide their identify by spoofing. Any attacker can craft a query to target a 3rd party victim. Combining this spoofing technique with amplification results in very large response floods towards the victim.
Figure 1: DNS Amplification Attack
4. Recursive Resolver is an Easy Target
The role of the DNS recursive resolver is to provide the hostname to IP translation service for users and devices. The recursive resolver queries the DNS hierarchy from root level through top level domains until the domain name server is reached. The resolution process is iterative, in the sense that the recursive resolver completes a query-response cycle for each level in the hierarchy until the name server is reached. Each domain server in the hierarchy delegates the next domain level as the next target for the recursive resolver, and so on until the host. For effectiveness, the recursive resolver caches the response to avoid a full iterative process the next time it is queries on this domain name.

5. NXDomain Attack and Negative Caching
In a NXDomain attack, also known as the random subdomains attack or DNS water torture, the attacker crafts queries with randomly generated sub-domains of a target domain. These randomly generated sub-domains will not exist in the recursive resolver’s cache, thus causing the recursive resolver to contact the authoritative DNS for the target domain using the full iterative process described above.
The NXDomain attack technique was used in the Mirai IoT attack on DynDNS in October 2016. A large army of Mirai bots targeted a specific victim’s domain by overwhelming its domain name servers with bogus requests, causing a denial of service for the victim but also causing a large amount of collateral damage on other domains served by the same name service.
[You may also like: Happy Dyn Attack Anniversary!]
The NXDomain attack technique can also target the recursive resolver, by incurring a critical performance degradation to the resolver due to cache-miss events which result in iterative queries to the DNS hierarchy and negative caching (negative caching is when the resolver’s cache is drained by random and useless responses caused be the attack). Negative caching impairs the recursive resolver’s efficiency and resiliency to overcome such attacks, thus making the attack impact even worse.
Figure 3: NXDomain Attack
6. NXNSAttack Attack
On May 19, 2020, academics from the Tel Aviv University and The Interdisciplinary Center in Israel discovered a vulnerability in the implementation of DNS recursive resolvers that can be abused to launch disruptive DDoS attacks against any victim. The attack leveraging the vulnerability has been dubbed NXNSAttack by the researchers. Radware published a detailed threat advisory here.
Unlike DDoS floods or application-level DDoS attacks that directly target and impact a host or a service, the NXNSAttack targets the domain name resolution capability of its victims. Like the NXDOMAIN or DNS Water Torture attack, the DDoS attack is aimed at disrupting the authoritative servers of the domain by overloading them with invalid requests using random domain request floods through recursive DNS resolvers. This attack is hard to detect and mitigate at the authoritative server because the requests originate from legitimate recursive DNS servers.
[You may also like: More Destructive Botnets and Attack Vectors Are on Their Way]
By disrupting name resolution for the domain, attackers effectively block access to all services provided under the domain. New clients will not be able to resolve the hostname of the service while under attack because they have no way of locating the IP address to connect to the service.
Unlike the limited 3x packet amplification factor of the NXDOMAIN attack, the NXNSAttack provides packet amplification factors ranging from 74x when attacking a subdomain (victim.com) up to 1621x when targeting a recursive resolver. The bandwidth amplification factors range between 21x for subdomain attacks and 163x when targeting a recursive resolver. Targeting root and top-level domain servers results in a packet amplification factor of 1071x and a bandwidth amplification factor of 99x. With high amplification rates and flexible targeting, NXNSAttack is a very capable attack vector which can be performed at scale.
Researchers have since disclosed the vulnerability and approached vendors and providers who have already patched their software and servers. Even with this disclosure, it is safe to assume that not all recursive resolvers, private and public, have been or ever will be patched. Therefore, this vector is still a major threat that can have destructive impact on the DNS infrastructure.
The Long Story of DNS Security
DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were introduced in 2005 through RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035 in attempt to preclude spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. While DNSSEC is aimed at providing origin authentication and data integrity, it does not address availability or confidentiality. Furthermore, DNSSEC adoption remains a long-term challenge and has been slow. DNSSEC is enabled on most top-level domains (TLDs) only, but not widely used beyond TLDs.
Another DNS enhancement was proposed in 2018 as DNS over HTTPS or DoH (RFC 8484). DoH’s aim is to increase the privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data through man-in-the-middle attacks.
Both DNSSEC and DoH can help with authentication, privacy and integrity; however, they cannot protect from query floods, NXDomain and NXNSDomain attacks. In some cases, DNSSEC and DoH can cause more damage than good as it helps malicious actors to better hide and make it harder on middle-box security providers to detect and prevent malicious or random domain names.
[You may also like: What to Do When You Are Under DDoS Attack]
What Can You Do to Ensure the Availability and Security of Your DNS?
So, what can an organization do to ensure DNS availability and secure the DNS infrastructure?
1.Secure the “Perimeter”—As demonstrated over and over, volumetric DNS attacks threaten the entire infrastructure and can saturate the ingress pipe. Provisioning DNS security solutions only inside the network is useless against such threats. A competent perimeter security solution for DNS is key to protecting this critical infrastructure.
2.Use “Stateless” Security—High-volume floods can consume resources of stateful devices such as DNS firewall and DNS servers. In order to protect from such floods, you need a “Stateless” security solution. 
3.Accurate Detection—The DNS security solution must make an accurate distinction in real time between good and bad DNS requests and then permit only the good DNS requests to the protected servers. Achieving high detection accuracy requires use of behavioral algorithms that can detect and mitigate emerging zero-day DNS attacks.
4.Early Detection—DNS firewalls and other stateful security systems require bi-directional traffic tracking for applying security. These solutions often rely on “bad” DNS responses (i.e., NXDomain) for detection. In some scenarios as explained above, the DNS server can be severely impacted by bogus requests, before the indication of the returning “bad” responses. You need a security solution that relies on ingress detection, namely a solution that can detect and mitigate an attack based on ingress requests only and prevent the bad queries from entering your DNS infrastructure to begin with.
The DNS infrastructure is critical to any organization and to the Internet’s normal operation.
Not securing the DNS infrastructure properly is like leaving an open window for cyber criminals—offering them free access to your network and your resources and risking your online business’ availability.

What is a DDoS Attack?
Introduction
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a non-intrusive internet attack made to take down the targeted website or slow it down by flooding the network, server or application with fake traffic. When against a vulnerable resource-intensive endpoint, even a tiny amount of traffic is enough for the attack to succeed.
 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are threats that website owners must familiarize themselves with as they are a critical piece of the security landscape. Navigating the various types of DDoS attacks can be challenging and time consuming. To help you understand what a DDoS attack is and how to prevent it, we have written the following guide.

Defining a DDoS attack
Understanding DDoS attacks
Unlike Denial of Service (DoS) attacks which come from a single source, DDoS attacks involve connected devices from multiple locations — also known as a botnet.
What is the objective of a DDoS attack?
The objective of a DDoS attack is to prevent legitimate users from accessing your website. Unlike other types of attacks, attackers do not use DDoS to breach your security perimeter. Instead, DDoS attacks are used to take down your website and prevent legitimate traffic, or used as a smokescreen for other malicious activities.
What makes a DDoS attack successful?
For a DDoS attack to be successful, the attacker needs to send more requests than the victim’s server can handle. Another way successful attacks occur is when the attacker sends bogus requests.
How does a DDoS attack work?
A DDoS attack will test the limits of a web server, network, and application resources by sending spikes of fake traffic. Some attacks are just short bursts of malicious requests on vulnerable endpoints such as search functions. DDoS attacks use an army of zombie devices called a botnet. These botnets generally consist of compromised IoT devices, websites, and computers.
When a DDoS attack is launched, the botnet will attack the target and deplete the application resources. A successful DDoS attack can prevent users from accessing a website or slow it down enough to increase bounce rate, resulting in financial losses and performance issues.
What is the goal behind a DDoS attack?
The main goal of an attacker that is leveraging a Denial of Service (DoS) attack method is to disrupt a website availability:
The website can become slow to respond to legitimate requests.
The website can be disabled entirely, making it impossible for legitimate users to access it.
Any type of disruption, depending on your configuration, can be devastating to your business.
Skip to section 4 to learn some of the reasons why.
What is the difference between DoS & DDoS attacks?
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are very similar. The only difference between them is their scale. Single DoS attacks come from one source, while DDoS (distributed) attacks come from multiple locations, often spoofed.
Whether a DoS or DDoS attack, the attacker uses one or more computers. DoS attacks are on the lower end of that spectrum while DDoS attacks are on the higher end. Very large DDoS attacks can span hundreds or thousands of systems. The proliferation of DoS/DDoS attacks are directly attributed to the proliferation of DDoS-for-hire services market, also known as Booter Services.
Can DDoS attacks steal information?
DDoS attacks cannot steal website visitors information. The sole purpose of a DDoS attack is to overload the website resources. However, DDoS attacks can be used as a way of extortion and blackmailing. For example, website owners can be asked to pay a ransom for attackers to stop a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks can have many other motivations including political, hacktivist, terrorist, and business competition. Anyone with a financial or ideological motive can damage an organization by launching a DDoS attack against it.
What are the signs of a DDoS attacks?
The signs of DDoS attacks include:
The website is responding slowly.
The website is unresponsive.
The user has problems accessing the website.
Internet connection issues if you are a target.
Any type of disruption, depending on your configuration, can be devastating to your business.
Skip to section 4 to learn some of the reasons why.
The amplification effect of DDoS attacks
Every time we talk about DDoS attacks, we have to mention its amplification effect. In order to achieve amplification, most attackers leverage botnets consisting of compromised computers, allowing them to amplify their attack across the size of the botnet. One attacker can control 1,000 bots which can then be used to DDoS the victim. That’s 1,000 bots vs. 1 server, making it easier for the attacker to win. However, not always do attackers need to be in control of the botnets. They can also make a host send a response to a wrong destination. For example, vulnerable memcached servers were used to take Github down and none of them were actually hacked, only fooled by the attacker.
The other aspect of amplification has to do with the network layer and spoofed requests. What if each computer on the botnet only needs to send 1 byte to get a 100 byte response? That’s called a 100x amplification. When the request is spoofed, the reply goes back to someone else on the internet, not the attacker. This means that the network port of the server is processing the 1 byte incoming + 100 bytes outgoing, while the attacker only processes the 1 byte outgoing on their end.
A theoretically small botnet of 1,000 bots can easily generate close to 100 Gbps when using the right amplification method.
Amplification does not stop there. Most people tend to think of them only in terms of Gigabytes of network, but there is also something happening at the application layer.
What if, with just 1 HTTP request from the botnet the attacker can force a web application to do a lot of work? Like an expensive search or something that takes lots of resources? That’s the basis of many Layer 7 (HTTP flood) attacks that we see.
Note
Can you imagine how hard it is for most servers to handle a DDoS attack?
We are talking about:
Thousands of bots, sending hundreds of requests per second, with network-layer amplification.
What happens during a DDoS attack?
Have you ever wondered what happens during a DDoS attack and what it looks like on the technical side?
A DDoS attack depletes the server resources and increases the website load time. When a DDoS attack hits a website, it may suffer performance issues or crash the server completely by overwhelming the server’ resources such as CPU, memory or even the entire network. Most DDoS attacks today originate from a hacker-controlled botnet of vulnerable IoT devices. This includes internet connected security cameras, household appliances, smart TVs, home lighting systems, and even refrigerators.
The exponential growth of DDoS attacks is mostly due to the total lack of regulatory control over IoT devices, which makes them excellent recruits for the botnets. A hijacked group of IoT devices with unique IP addresses can be redirected to make malicious requests against websites, causing a DDoS attack.
DDoS attack example
To help you understand what an attack looks like, we’ve captured a live example of a website being DDoSed. You’l be able to clearly see how the website’s performance becomes disrupted in a matter of minutes, and watch how server resources become depleted.
This video will help you recognize the telltale signs and behavior you can expect to find if your site comes under DDoS attack.
Types of DDoS Attacks
Some types of DDoS attacks are designed to consume web server resources. The outcome is that they slow down or completely halt your server or website.
The internet of things (IoT) is a network of physical devices which are embedded within electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity. These objects are able to connect and exchange data that can also be used in malicious attacks.
Your devices, such as home routers, can be compromised and act as a botnet for DDoS attacks.
We have discovered a number of large-scale DDoS attacks related to IoT devices. You can read the articles here:
Large CCTV Botnet Leveraged in DDoS Attacks
IoT Home Router Botnet Leveraged in Large DDoS Attack
In the following sections we review some types of DDoS attacks.
Volume-based DDoS attacks
As the name implies, volume-based DDoS attacks depend on the volume of inbound traffic. The goal of this type of attack is to overload the website’s bandwidth or cause CPU or IOPS usage issues.
The attacker employs a basic tactic – more resources wins this game. If they can overload your resources, the attack is successful.
It is quite easy for attackers to achieve their goals. Most website owners are leveraging shared hosts and the ones with virtual private server (VPS) environments are often set up in the smallest tiers and configurations.
This attack can be measured in bits per second.
Volume-based DDoS attacks include:
UDP floods
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) DoS attack will flood various ports at random, leading the host server to report back with an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet. This is a protocol used to generate error messages to the IP address when problems prevent IP packets delivery. The UDP floods are done via packets – also known as Layer 3 / 4 attacks. This forces the web server to respond, in turn chewing through your web server resources forcing it to come to a halt or die completely. UDP is a connectionless protocol, meaning it doesn’t validate source IP addresses. It’s because of this that UDP attacks are often associated with Distributed Reflective Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks.
ICMP floods
Attackers flood the server with spoofed ICMP packets sent from a huge set of source IPs. The result of this attack is the exhaustion of server resources and failure to process requests, causing the server to reboot or lead to an extensive impact on its performance. ICMP flood attacks can be targeted at specific servers or they can be random. It essentially consumes bandwidth to the point of exhaustion.
Ping floods
Attackers flood the server with spoofed ping packets from a huge set of source IPs. It is an evolution of the ICMP flood attacks. The attacker’s objective is to flood the server until it goes offline. The biggest downside from this attack for website owners is that it can be difficult to detect, mistaken for legitimate traffic.
Protocol-based DDoS attacks
The internet is based on protocols. It’s how things get from point A to point B. DDoS attacks based on protocols exploit weaknesses in Layers 3 and 4 protocol stacks. This type of attack consumes the server resources, or any other network hardware, in the middle of processing capacities. The result is service disruption.
These attacks try to exploit your network stack by sending either more packets than what your server can handle or more bandwidth than what your network ports can handle.
The attacks can be measured in packets per second (Pps).
Protocol-based DDoS attacks include:
Ping of Death
Attackers send malicious pings to a server, manipulating the IP protocols. This attack was very common in the 1990s. Nowadays, even though attacks have evolved, there are some forms of Ping of Death attacks that can be targeted at applications or hardware. The result of this attack is the reboot or complete crash of the server. That is exactly why a DoS attack cannot be devalued: a single attacker could take a complete data center down.
SYN Flood
Attackers exploit weaknesses in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection three-way handshake, which is the communication process between the client, the host, and the server. Attackers send SYN packets to the aimed server as a spoofed message until the table memory connection of the server is exhausted causing the entire service to shut down.
Application layer attacks
The basis for this attack often targets applications like Web Servers (i.e., Windows IIS, Apache, etc…); however, application layer attacks have been evolving to application platforms like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, and others.
The goal of application layer attacks is to take out an application, an online service, or a website.
These attacks are usually smaller than the ones we have seen before. Nevertheless, the consequence of an application layer attack can be nefarious, since they can go unnoticed until it is too late to react. That is why they are called “low and slow attacks” or even “slow-rate attacks”. They can be silent and small, especially when compared to network-layer attacks, but they can be just as disruptive.
For example, a small VPS on Linode, Digital Ocean or AWS (Amazon) can easily handle a 100,000 to 200,000 packets per second SYN flood. However, the same server running on a WordPress or Joomla CMS can barely break 500 HTTP requests per second without shutting down. That is why application layer attacks can cause as much damage as a network application attack.
When you think about the amplification effect that we discussed in Section 1.4, even one HTTP request (which an attacker can perform without spending much money or resources) can cause a server to execute a large number of internal requests and load numerous files to create the page.
Application-layer attacks (mostly known as Layer 7 attacks) can be part of attacks which not only target the application, but also the bandwidth and network.
One of the reasons why these attacks are on the rise is that they tend to be less expensive to implement by malicious actors. On an application-layer attack, the amplification is CPU, memory or resource based, not network based.
These attacks are also harder to detect than network-layer attacks.
Your devices, such as home routers, can be compromised and act as a botnet for DDoS attacks. We have discovered a number of large-scale DDoS attacks related to IoT devices.
Application Layer Attacks include:
Attacks targeting the DNS server:
The Domain Name System (DNS) is vital to the website infrastructure. DNS associates information with domain names and they can also be a target of DDoS attacks.
These attacks use spoofing, reflection, and amplification, which means that a tiny query can be largely amplified in order to result in a much larger response in bytes.
Botnets are used to send DNS requests. If the attacker wanted to target a DNS server, it would use all the botnet zombies in his network to issue DNS request messages for an amplification record from open recursive DNS servers that translate domain names into IP addresses. When it is a new request, the server promptly issues its own request to an infected server with a view to obtain the amplification record. This attack is completed using spoofing so that even though the server has never sent a request, it has been overburdened with responses.
These attacks are very popular today. They occur at Layers 3 / 4, using publicly accessible DNS servers around the world to overwhelm your web server with DNS response traffic. Your web server is overwhelmed by the influx of responses in turn making it difficult to function as its resources are depleted, making it impossible to respond to legitimate DNS traffic.
A Layer 3 DNS Amplification is a type of DDoS attack where the attacker hides the origin of the attack from the targeted site by reflecting the attack off of a third party. It uses amplification, meaning that the victim receives more byte counts than what is being sent from the attacker, increasing the power of the attack.
If these attacks are successful, the targeted site will go down and be unavailable.
Layer 7 HTTP Flood – Cache Bypass:
Layer 7 HTTP Flood – Cache Bypass is the smartest type of attack. The attackers try to use URLs that cause the most damage making the site use up all of its resources without being cached. For example, an attack can do random dictionary searches for “news”, “gov”, “faith”, which will consume a lot from the site and will not easily be detected since it looks like a normal user’s search habits.
Layer 7 HTTP Flood Attack:
A Layer 7 HTTP Flood Attack is a type of DDoS attack made to overload specific parts of a site or server. They are complex and hard to detect because the sent requests look like legitimate traffic. These requests consume the server’s resources causing the site to go down. These requests can also be sent by bots, increasing the attack’s power.
An interesting point about layer 7 DDOS attacks, aka HTTP flood attacks, is that they have little dependency on bandwidth allowing them to easily take down a server by overloading its resources. Depending on the web server and application stack, even a low number of requests per second can choke the application and backend databases. On average, attacks greater than 100 requests per second have the potential to bring down most mid-sized websites.
The issue with this type of attack is that server-level caching is unable to stop it. The incoming URLs are dynamic and the application forces a reload of the content from the database for every new request that is not in cache, which creates a new page. Attackers know this, 
making it the preferred method of attack for today’s Layer 7 DDoS attacks.
We categorize the HTTP Floods (Layer 7 DDoS attempts) into 4 major categories:
Basic HTTP Floods: Common and simple attacks that try to access the same page over and over. They generally use the same range of IP addresses, user agents, and referrers.
Randomized HTTP Floods: Complex attacks that leverage a large pool of IP addresses and randomized the URLs, useragents and referers used.
Cache-bypass HTTP Floods: A sub-category of the randomized HTTP Floods that also try to bypass web application caching.
WordPress XMLRPC Floods: A sub-category that uses WordPress pingback as a reflection for the attacks.
Any WordPress site with pingback enabled, which is on by default, can be used in DDoS attacks against other sites.
XMLRPC is used for pingbacks, trackbacks, remote access via mobile devices and many other features. However, it can also be heavily misused by attackers.
What can happen is that other WordPress sites can send random requests at a very large scale and bring a website down.
One attacker can use thousands of clean WordPress installations to perform a DDoS attack with a simple pingback request to the XML-RPC file. In other words, a simple command in Linux can start a mammoth attack.

DDoS
Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) Definition
A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to make an online service unavailable to users, usually by temporarily interrupting or suspending the services of its hosting server.

A DDoS attack is launched from numerous compromised devices, often distributed globally in what is referred to as a botnet. It is distinct from other denial of service (DoS) attacks in that it uses a single Internet-connected device (one network connection) to flood a target with malicious traffic. This nuance is the main reason for the existence of these two somewhat different definitions.
This is part of an extensive series of guides about hacking
“And that concludes our DDoS party: Escapist Magazine, Eve Online, Minecraft, League of Legends + 8 phone requests.” Tweeted by LulzSec – June 14, 2011, 11:07PM
Broadly speaking, DoS and DDoS attacks can be divided into three types:
Volume Based Attacks
Includes UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed-packet floods. The attack’s goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and magnitude is measured in bits per second (Bps).
Protocol Attacks 
Includes SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, Ping of Death, Smurf DDoS, and more. This type of attack consumes actual server resources, or those of intermediate communication equipment, such as firewalls and load balancers, and is measured in packets per second (Pps).
Application Layer Attacks 
Includes low-and-slow attacks, GET/POST floods, attacks that target Apache, Windows, or OpenBSD vulnerabilities, and more. Comprised of seemingly legitimate and innocent requests, these attacks aim to crash the web server, and the magnitude is measured in Requests per second (Rps).
Common DDoS Attack Types
While a DDoS attack intends to disrupt some or all of its target’s services, not all DDoS attacks are the same. They feature unique characteristics, methods, and attack vectors. There are three common types of DDoS attacks:
Volumetric (Gbps)
Protocol (pps)
Application layer (rps) attacks.
Since these three are categorized as DDoS attacks, the terms are often confused or used interchangeably by accident. Complicating matters, there are times when these types of DDoS attacks overlap during a single attack to generate greater impact.
Attackers don’t make clean distinctions between these three types of DDoS attacks. Their goal is to disrupt your business. When attacking their target, they’ll combine volumetric, protocol, and application layer attacks into a multi-vector attack. Multi-vector attacks hit the target in varying forms and disrupt the processes at a higher level.
What is a Gbps or Volumetric DDoS Attack
A volumetric DDoS attack is what most people associate with the term “DDoS” because it is the most common. The first volumetric DDoS attack made headlines in the late 1990s and has since spawned an army of copycats.
Volumetric attacks can also be called “floods” because an attack floods a target’s server with requests, like unwanted pings. Attacks are measured in bits per second (bps) or Gigabits per second (Gbps).
The concept of a volumetric attack is simple: send as much traffic as possible to a site to overwhelm the server’s bandwidth. Volumetric attacks are typically produced using amplification techniques. DNS amplification is one of the more common techniques attackers use to carry out a volumetric attack. The bad actor sends small DNS requests with the victim’s spoofed source IP address to a DNS server. When the server receives the request, it responds to the victim with a large response.
Attackers also create volumetric attacks using botnets made up of exploited IoT devices. Connected devices usually lack basic security defenses, but because they’re connected to the Internet and can execute code, they can be easily exploited.
The proliferation of cheap IoT devices like toys, small appliances, thermostats, security cameras, and Wi-Fi routers makes it easy to launch an effective attack with just a few clicks. A hacker can easily leverage the extensibility of the internet to launch a successful volumetric DDoS attack with few resources.
The Mirai botnet is an example of the devastation of leveraged, unsecured IoT devices. Mirai targeted IoT devices, using each infected device to join a volumetric DDoS attack. It resulted in successful attacks against some of the world’s largest organizations.
What is a PPS or Network Protocol DDoS Attack?
An internet protocol is a discrete set of rules for exchanging information across the internet. TCP/IP is one of the most well-known rules for exchanging requests and data. A bad actor can severely disrupt an online service by exploiting these rules.
Protocol attacks often work at layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model on network devices like routers. Because they are on the network layer, they are measured in packets per second (pps).
Below is a sampling of different network-layer DDoS attack types:
UDP floods
SYN floods
NTP amplification
DNS amplification
SSDP amplification
IP fragmentation
SYN-ACK floods
Examples of a Network Protocol DDoS Attack
The ping of death (POD) is an IP fragmentation attack that exploits the inherent size limitation of a packet. By manipulating parts of the packet or fragments, the exploit can overflow the memory buffers allocated to that packet and then deny service to legitimate packets.
A TCP SYN flood is another common protocol attack. Here, a surge of TCP SYN requests directed towards a target overwhelms the target and makes it unresponsive.
What is an RPS or Application Layer DDoS Attack
While volumetric attacks and — to a lesser extent — protocol attacks compromise a service with the sheer number of requests, application layer attacks, or layer 7 attacks, target an edge server that executes a web application.
These threats are harder to detect because attackers usually make requests like legitimate users. Consequently, these attacks often show up as smaller traffic spikes and do not require the assistance of a botnet.
Application layer attacks are measured in requests per second (RPS) — the number of requests an application makes. An application layer attack is considered a resource-based attack; therefore, it takes fewer requests to bring down an application because the attack is focused on overwhelming the CPU and memory.
An application layer attack typically includes hitting the web server, running PHP scripts, and contacting the database to load web pages. A single HTTP request, which is simple to execute on the client side, can cause a server to execute many internal requests and load numerous files to fulfill the request, which slows the system.
An application layer attack can also be a multi-vector attack that uses a combination of volumetric and protocol attacks to increase the likelihood of taking a service offline. Because of their complexity and effectiveness, multi-vector attacks are increasingly popular among cybercriminal groups.

Volumetric Attack	Bits per second (bps), Gigabits per second (Gbps), flood	Connectionless	High volume, using bots	UDP flood	Volumetric attacks are absorbed in a global network of scrubbing centers that scale on demand to counter multi-gigabyte DDoS attacks.

Application layer attack	Requests per second (RPS), low-rate	Connection-based	Difficult to detect	SQL injection, XSS	Application layer attacks are blocked by monitoring visitor behavior, blocking known bad bots, and challenging suspicious or unrecognized entities with JS test, cookie challenge, and even CAPTCHAs.

The Motivation Behind DDoS Attacks
DDoS attacks are quickly becoming the most prevalent type of cyber threat, growing rapidly in the past year in both number and volume, according to recent market research. The trend is towards shorter attack duration but bigger packet-per-second attack volume.
Attackers are primarily motivated by:
Ideology – So-called “hacktivists” use DDoS attacks to target websites they disagree with ideologically.
Business feuds – Businesses can use DDoS attacks to strategically take down competitor websites, e.g., to keep them from participating in a significant event, such as Cyber Monday.
Boredom – Cyber vandals, a.k.a. “script-kiddies,” use prewritten scripts to launch DDoS attacks. The perpetrators of these attacks are typically bored, would-be hackers looking for an adrenaline rush.
Extortion – Perpetrators use DDoS attacks, or the threat of DDoS attacks, to extort money from their targets.
Cyber warfare – Government-authorized DDoS attacks can be used to both cripple opposition websites and an enemy country’s infrastructure.LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon): an “entry-level” DoS attack tool used for cyber vandalism

TCP SYN Flood
250.5k views
DDoS
Delve into the intricacies of TCP SYN Flood, a prevalent denial-of-service attack. Learn about its mechanisms, the potential risks it poses to computer networks, and the strategies employed to counteract such threats.
Introduction
In the vast realm of cyber threats, the TCP SYN Flood stands out as a particularly nefarious form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack. By exploiting the very protocols that govern internet communication, attackers can overwhelm servers, rendering them unresponsive to legitimate requests.
What is TCP SYN Flood?
A TCP SYN Flood attack seeks to exploit the TCP three-way handshake mechanism, which is foundational for establishing connections in TCP/IP networks. The handshake involves three steps:
1.A client sends a SYN (synchronize) message to a server, indicating a desire to establish a connection.
2.The server acknowledges this request by sending a SYN-ACK message back to the client.
3.The client responds with an ACK (acknowledgment), and the connection is officially established.
In a TCP SYN Flood attack, the malicious entity sends a barrage of SYN requests to a target server but intentionally avoids sending the final ACK. This leaves the server waiting for a response that never comes, consuming resources for each of these half-open connections.

Progression of a SYN flood.
The Impact on Networks
The primary objective of a TCP SYN Flood is resource exhaustion. As the server continues to allocate resources for these half-open connections, it becomes increasingly strained, eventually reaching a point where it cannot respond to legitimate traffic. This results in:
Service Disruption: Legitimate users find it difficult or impossible to access the affected service.
Resource Strain: The server’s resources, including memory and processing power, are consumed by the flood of bogus requests.
Potential System Failures: In extreme cases, the server might crash or malfunction due to the overwhelming number of half-open connections.
Mitigating TCP SYN Flood Attacks
Given the potential damage a TCP SYN Flood can inflict, it’s crucial to have defenses in place. Some of the most effective strategies include:
Filtering: By setting up robust filtering rules, networks can identify and block malicious SYN requests based on specific patterns or known malicious IP addresses.
Increasing Backlog: By increasing the backlog queue, servers can handle a larger number of incoming SYN requests, providing a buffer against flooding attempts.
Reducing SYN-RECEIVED Timer: By reducing the time the server waits for an ACK response after sending a SYN-ACK, resources allocated to half-open connections are freed up more quickly.
SYN Cache: Instead of allocating significant resources for each incoming SYN request, the server can use a cache to store a smaller amount of information about each request, conserving resources.
SYN Cookies: This technique involves the server sending back a SYN-ACK response without allocating any resources for the connection. Only when the server receives a legitimate ACK response does it allocate resources for the connection.
Hybrid Approaches: Combining multiple techniques can provide a layered defense against TCP SYN Flood attacks, ensuring that even if one method fails, others can still provide protection.
Firewalls and Proxies: Deploying firewalls and proxies can help filter out malicious traffic before it reaches the target server, providing an additional layer of defense.

The History of TCP SYN Flood Attacks
The TCP SYN Flood attack is not a new phenomenon. Its origins can be traced back to the dawn of the internet when network security was in its infancy. As the internet grew in popularity and commercial significance, malicious actors became more motivated to exploit potential vulnerabilities.
Early Incidents
One of the earliest recorded instances of a TCP SYN Flood attack occurred in the late 1990s. At the time, many organizations were still grappling with the nuances of online security. The attack targeted a prominent online platform, causing significant downtime and drawing attention to the vulnerabilities inherent in the TCP/IP protocol.
Evolution Over Time
As network security tools and techniques evolved, so did the methods employed by attackers. The basic premise of the TCP SYN Flood attack remained consistent, but attackers began using more sophisticated tools and techniques to increase their impact and evade detection.
The Psychology Behind a TCP SYN Attack
Understanding the motivations behind cyberattacks can provide valuable insights into preventing future incidents. In the case of TCP SYN Flood attacks, motivations can vary:
Hacktivism: Some attackers, known as hacktivists, launch attacks to make political or social statements. They might target specific organizations or industries they perceive as unethical.
Competition: In some cases, businesses have been suspected of launching or sponsoring attacks against competitors to gain a competitive edge.
Ransom: Some attackers use TCP SYN Flood as a means to extort money from organizations. They threaten to or initiate an attack and demand payment to stop it.
Malice: Some individuals or groups launch attacks simply for the thrill of it, with no other underlying motivation.
Advanced Techniques and Variations
While the basic methodology of a TCP SYN Flood remains consistent, there are variations and advanced techniques:
Reflection Attacks
In a reflection attack, the attacker sends SYN requests to various servers with a spoofed IP address (the victim’s). These servers then send SYN-ACK responses to the victim, overwhelming them.
Distributed Attacks
Rather than launching the attack from a single source, attackers use multiple compromised devices, forming what’s known as a botnet. This distributed approach can amplify the attack’s impact and make it harder to trace and mitigate.
The Broader Implications of TCP SYN Flood Attacks
Beyond the implications on network security, a TCP SYN Flood attack can have broader societal and economic impacts:
Economic Impact: Businesses can suffer significant financial losses due to downtime, lost sales, and the costs associated with mitigation and recovery.
Trust and Reputation: Repeated attacks can erode trust among customers and partners, leading to long-term reputational damage.
Regulatory and Legal Implications: In many jurisdictions, there are now regulations in place that mandate certain security standards, especially for industries like finance and healthcare. Non-compliance, even as a result of an attack, can lead to penalties.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
225.7k views
DDoS
DDoS meaning: What is DDoS?
Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a subclass of denial of service (DoS) attacks. A DDoS attack involves multiple connected online devices, collectively known as a botnet, which are used to overwhelm a target website with fake traffic.
Unlike other kinds of cyberattacks, DDoS assaults don’t attempt to breach your security perimeter. Rather, a DDoS attack aims to make your website and servers unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS can also be used as a smokescreen for other malicious activities and to take down security appliances, breaching the target’s security perimeter.
A successful distributed denial of service attack is a highly noticeable event impacting an entire online user base. This makes it a popular weapon of choice for hacktivists, cyber vandals, extortionists and anyone else looking to make a point or champion a cause.
DDoS attacks can come in short bursts or repeat assaults, but either way the impact on a website or business can last for days, weeks and even months, as the organization tries to recover. This can make DDoS extremely destructive to any online organization. Amongst other things, DDoS attacks can lead to loss of revenues, erode consumer trust, force businesses to spend fortunes in compensations and cause long-term reputation damage.
DoS vs. DDoS
The differences between regular and distributed denial of service assaults are substantive. In a DoS attack, a perpetrator uses a single Internet connection to either exploit a software vulnerability or flood a target with fake requests—usually in an attempt to exhaust server resources (e.g., RAM and CPU).
On the other hand, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are launched from multiple connected devices that are distributed across the Internet. These multi-person, multi-device barrages are generally harder to deflect, mostly due to the sheer volume of devices involved. Unlike single-source DoS assaults, DDoS attacks tend to target the network infrastructure in an attempt to saturate it with huge volumes of traffic.
DDoS attacks also differ in the manner of their execution. Broadly speaking, denial of service attacks are launched using homebrewed scripts or DoS tools (e.g., Low Orbit Ion Canon), while DDoS attacks are launched from botnets — large clusters of connected devices (e.g., cellphones, PCs or routers) infected with malware that allows remote control by an attacker.
DDoS botnets: waging large-scale attacks
A botnet is a collection of hijacked connected devices used for cyber attacks that are controlled remotely from a Command & Control Center (C&C). These typically include personal computers, mobile phones, unsecured IoT devices, and even resources from public cloud services. Attackers use malware and other techniques to compromise a device, turning it into a “zombie” in the attacker’s botnet.
Botnets enable attackers to carry out DDoS attacks by harnessing the power of many machines and obscuring the source of the traffic. Since traffic is distributed, it is difficult for security tools and teams to detect that a DDoS attack is occurring until it is too late.
To learn more about large-scale DDoS infrastructure, see our article on DDoS botnets.
Types of DDoS attacks
DoS attacks can be divided into two general categories—application layer attacks and network layer attacks. Each of these types of DDoS attacks define certain parameters and behaviors used during the attack, as well as the target of the attack.
1.Application layer attacks (a.k.a., layer 7 attacks) can be either DoS or DDoS threats that seek to overload a server by sending a large number of requests requiring resource-intensive handling and processing. Among other attack vectors, this category includes HTTP floods, slow attacks (e.g., Slowloris or RUDY) and DNS query flood attacks.

Gaming website hit with a massive DNS flood, peaking at over 25 million packets per second
The size of application layer attacks is typically measured in requests per second (RPS), with no more than 50 to 100 RPS being required to cripple most mid-sized websites.
2.Network layer attacks (a.k.a., layer 3–4 attacks) are almost always DDoS assaults set up to clog the “pipelines” connecting your network. Attack vectors in this category include UDP flood, SYN flood, NTP amplification and DNS amplification attacks, and more.
Any of these can be used to prevent access to your servers, while also causing severe operational damages, such as account suspension and massive overage charges.
DDoS attacks are almost always high-traffic events, commonly measured in gigabits per second (Gbps) or packets per second (PPS). The largest network layer assaults can exceed hundreds  Gbps; however, 20 to 40 Gbps are enough to completely shut down most network infrastructures.
Reasons for DDoSing: Attacker motivations
“DDoSsing” describes the act of carrying out a DDoS attack. Denial of service attacks are launched by individuals, businesses and even nation-states, each with their own motivation.
Hacktivism
Hacktivists use DoS attacks as a means to express their criticism of everything, from governments and politicians, including “big business”, and current events. If hacktivists disagree with you, your site is going to go down (a.k.a., “tango down”).
Less technically-savvy than other types of attackers, hacktivists tend to use premade tools to wage assaults against their targets. Anonymous is perhaps one of the best-known hacktivist groups. They’re responsible for the cyber attack in February 2015 against ISIS, following the latter’s terrorist attack against the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, as well as the attack against the Brazilian government and World Cup sponsors in June 2014.
Typical assault method of hacktivists: DoS and DDoS.
Cyber vandalism
Cyber vandals are often referred to as “script kiddies”—for their reliance on premade scripts and tools to cause grief to their fellow Internet citizens. These vandals are often bored teenagers looking for an adrenaline rush, or seeking to vent their anger or frustration against an institution (e.g., school) or person they feel has wronged them. Some are , of course, just looking for attention and the respect of their peers.
Alongside premade tools and scripts, cyber vandals will also result to using DDoS-for-hire services (a.k.a., booters or stressers), which can be purchased online for as little as $19 a pop.
Extortion
An increasingly popular motivation for DDoS attacks is extortion, meaning a cybercriminal demands money in exchange for stopping (or not carrying out) a crippling DDoS attack. Several prominent online software companies—including MeetUp, Bitly, Vimeo, and Basecamp—have been on the receiving end of these DDoS notes, some going offline after refusing to succumb to the extortionists’ threats.
Similar to cyber-vandalism, this type of attack is enabled by the existence of stresser and booter services.
Typical assault method of extortionists: DDoS.
Business competition
DDoS attacks are increasingly being used as a competitive business tool. Some of these assaults are designed to keep a competitor from participating in a significant event (e.g., Cyber Monday), while others are launched with a goal of completely shutting down online businesses for months.
One way or another, the idea is to cause disruption that will encourage your customers to flock to the competitor while also causing financial and reputational damage. An average cost of a DDoS attack to an organization can run at $40,000 per hour.
Business-feud attacks are often well-funded and executed by professional “hired guns,” who conduct early reconnaissance and use proprietary tools and resources to sustain extremely aggressive and persistent DDoS attacks.
Typical assault method used by business competitors: DDoS.
Cyber warfare
State-sponsored DDoS attacks are being used to silence government critics and internal opposition, as well as a means to disrupt critical financial, health, and infrastructure services in enemy countries.
These attacks are backed by nation-states, meaning they are well-funded and orchestrated campaigns that are executed by tech-savvy professionals.
Typical assault method employed as cyber warfare: DDoS.
Personal rivalry
DoS attacks can be used to settle personal scores or to disrupt online competitions. Such assaults often occur in the context of multiplayer online games, where players launch DDoS barrages against one another, and even against gaming servers, to gain an edge or to avoid imminent defeat by “flipping the table.”
Attacks against players are often DoS assaults, executed with widely available malicious software. Conversely, attacks against gaming servers are likely to be DDoS assaults, launched by stressers and booters.
Typical assault method of personal rivals: DoS, DDoS.
Read our article to learn more about DDoSing in online gaming.
DDoS for hire: DDoSsers, booters and stressers
DDoS for hire providers offer to perform DDoS attacks on the behalf of others for payment. These threat actors are known by multiple names, including DDoSser, booters, and stressers. The wide availability of DDoS for hire makes it possible for almost anyone to wage large-scale attacks.
One reason actors may go by a particular name is to appear as a legal service. For example, stressers typically claim to offer services for stress testing server resilience. However, these actors often do not verify the owner of the server they are “testing” to ensure tests are legitimate.
In contrast, actors who refer to themselves as booters and DDoSsers typically don’t try to hide the illegal nature of their services.

Example of booter advertised prices and capacities
To learn more about types of DDoS attackers, see our article on DDoSsers, booters and stressers.
How to stop DDoS attacks: DIY
You can’t prevent DoS assaults. Cybercriminals are going to attack. Some are going to hit their targets, regardless of the defenses in place. However, there are a few preventive measures you can take on your own:
Monitoring your traffic to look for abnormalities, including unexplained traffic spikes and visits from suspect IP address and geolocations. All of these could be signs of attackers performing “dry runs” to test your defenses before committing to a full-fledged attack. Recognizing these for what they are can help you prepare for the onslaught to follow.
Keep an eye on social media (particularly Twitter) and public waste bins (e.g., Pastebin.com) for threats, conversations and boasts that may hint on an incoming attack.
Consider using third-party DDoS testing (i.e., pen testing) to simulate an attack against your IT infrastructure so you can be prepared when the moment of truth arrives. When you undertake this, test against a wide variety of attacks, not just those with which you are familiar with.
Create a response plan and a rapid response team, meaning a designated group of people whose job is to minimize the impact of an assault. When you plan, put in place procedures for your customer support and communication teams, not just for your IT professionals.
To truly protect against modern DDoS attacks, you should use a DDoS mitigation solution. Solutions can be deployed on-premises, but are more commonly provided as a service by third-party providers. We explain more about DDoS mitigation services in the following section.
To learn more about DIY, on-premise, and cloud service approaches to DDoS protection, see our article on how to stop DDoS attacks.
DDoS mitigation: How does anti-DDoS protection work?
This first step in selecting a DDoS mitigation solution is to assess your risk. Important basic questions include:
Which infrastructure assets need protection?
What are the soft spots, or single points of failure?
What is required to take them down?
How and when will you know you’re targeted? Will it be too late?
What are the impacts (financial and otherwise) of an extended outage?
Armed with this information, it’s then time to prioritize your concerns, examining various DDoS mitigation options within the framework of your security budget.
If you’re running a commercial website or online applications (e.g., SaaS applications, online banking, e-commerce), you’re probably going to want 24×7, always-on protection. A large law firm, on the other hand, may be more interested in protecting its infrastructure—including email servers, FTP servers, and back office platforms—than its website. This type of business may opt for an ”on demand“ solution.
The second step is to choose the method of deployment. The most common and effective way to deploy on-demand DDoS protection for your core infrastructure services across an entire subnet is via border gateway protocol (BGP) routing. However, this will only work on demand, requiring you to manually activate the security solution in case of an attack.
Consequently, if you’re in need of always-on DDoS protection for your web application, you should use DNS redirection to reroute all website traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) through your DDoS protection provider’s network (usually integrated with a content delivery network,). The advantage of this solution is that most CDNs offer on-call scalability to absorb volumetric attacks, at the same time minimizing latency and accelerating content delivery.
Mitigating Network Layer Attacks
Dealing with network layer attacks required requires additional scalability—beyond what your own network can offer.
Consequently, in the event of an assault, a BGP announcement is made to ensure that all incoming traffic is routed through a set of scrubbing centers. Each of these has the capacity to process hundreds of Gbps worth of traffic. Powerful servers located in the scrubbing centers will then filter out malicious packets, only forwarding the clean traffic to the origin server through a GRE tunnel.
This method of mitigation provides protection against direct-to-IP attacks and is usually compatible with all types of infrastructures and communication protocols (e.g., UDP, SMTP, FTP, VoIP).

Protecting against an NTP amplification attack: 180Gbps and 50 million packets per second
Mitigating Application Layer Attacks
Mitigation of application layer attacks relies on traffic profiling solutions that can scale on demand, while also being able to distinguish between malicious bots and legitimate website visitors.
For traffic profiling, best practices call for signature-based and behavior-based heuristics, combined with IP reputation scoring and a progressive use of security challenges (e.g., JS and cookie challenges).

Ping flood (ICMP flood)
205k views
DDoS
What is a Ping Flood?
A ping flood, also known as an ICMP flood, is a type of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in which an attacker overwhelms the targeted device or network with continuous request packets (pings). This can cause network congestion and prevent legitimate users from accessing network resources.
How a Ping Flood Works
In a ping flood attack, the perpetrator uses multiple compromised systems to send a huge volume of ICMP echo requests to the target. These echo request packets are sent to the broadcast IP address 255.255.255.255, which allows them to be delivered to all connected devices.
The target system tries to respond to each ICMP echo request with an echo reply packet. However, with thousands or even millions of echo requests coming in per second, the target is unable to handle the traffic volume. The incoming ping flood occupies all of the target’s inbound bandwidth, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.
Ping of Death Attack
A variation on the ping flood is the Ping of Death attack. In this type of assault, the attacker sends malformed or oversized ICMP packets that exceed the maximum IPv4 packet size of 65,535 bytes. This crashes or freezes the target system as it struggles to process the oversized packets.
While most modern operating systems are no longer vulnerable to Ping of-Death attacks, a large ping flood using normal-sized packets can still be used to achieve denial-of-service.
Technical Example of a Ping Flood
A ping flood can be initiated using a simple ping command from the command line. For example:
ping -t <target IP> -l 65500
This will send a continuous stream of ping packets to the target IP address, with a packet size of 65,500 bytes (the maximum allowed by IPv4). Executing this command from multiple attacking devices could overwhelm the target network with hundreds of thousands of large ICMP packets per second.
Ping Flood vs. Smurf Attack
A smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service technique related to a ping flood. The key difference is that smurf attacks leverage spoofing of the source IP address.
In a smurf attack, the perpetrator sends a large amount of ICMP traffic to the broadcast address of the target network but spoofs the source IP address to be the victim’s address. When all the hosts on the network receive and respond to the ICMP echo request, it multiplies the amount of traffic flooding the victim.
With a ping flood, the source of the attack traffic is more visible. But a smurf attack hides the true origin, enabling an amplification effect through broadcast messaging.
Ping Flood vs. SYN Flood
Ping floods are sometimes confused with SYN floods, another common DDoS technique. While both overwhelm the target with bogus traffic, there are some key differences:
Protocol used – Ping floods use ICMP echo requests, while SYN floods leverage TCP SYN packets.
Connection establishment – Ping floods do not open any TCP connections, while SYN floods attempt to open many connections that are never completed.
Impact – Ping floods consume more inbound bandwidth, while SYN floods put more demand on server resources because of the need to track half-open connections.
Detection – Ping floods are easier to identify based on the volume of ICMP traffic. SYN floods can be harder to distinguish from legitimate connection requests.
In summary, ping floods are heavier on bandwidth consumption, while SYN floods require more server processing overhead. But both can effectively deny service to legitimate users.
Effects of a Ping Flood
Some of the major effects on a system undergoing a ping flood include:
Network Saturation
The huge volume of ICMP echo requests saturates the target’s inbound bandwidth, making it impossible for legitimate users to access network resources. Web servers, email servers, and other public-facing systems become unreachable.
System Resource Exhaustion
The flood of ICMP packets consumes a large percentage of router, firewall, and server CPU cycles. This CPU overload causes widespread performance issues or even crashes systems entirely. Available memory can also be consumed while attempting to process the attack traffic.
Service Disruption
Any services hosted on the flooded device or network segment become unavailable due to the network saturation. Websites time out, cloud-based services are blocked, and applications that rely on the network stop working properly.
Reputation Damage (for email servers)
For email servers, a ping flood can cause inbound emails to bounce and be returned as undeliverable. This results in the server’s IP address being added to real-time blackhole lists (RBLs). Other email servers will reject messages from IP addresses on blackhole lists, causing further delivery disruptions after the attack.
Financial Loss
Taken together, the inability to process transactions, loss of productivity, and damage to reputation represent significant financial costs stemming from a successful ping flood attack. Costs grow exponentially with attack volume and duration.
Ping Flood Defense Strategies
Defending against ping floods involves using a layered approach with the following components:
Traffic Rate Limiting
Rate limiting sets a maximum threshold on the number of ICMP echo requests that can be processed per second. Requests exceeding the threshold are dropped or deprioritized. This prevents any single source from overwhelming the target.
Infrastructure Capacity Planning
Proactively increasing bandwidth, server resources, and network capabilities can help absorb a certain volume of ICMP traffic without service disruption. However, this may completely negate the effects of a very high-volume attack.
ICMP Protocol Blocking
Blocking ICMP altogether at the network perimeter prevents any ICMP requests from reaching vulnerable servers. However, this can also prevent legitimate troubleshooting with the ping utility. ICMP blocking should be applied selectively rather than network-wide.
Blackhole Filtering
Routers and firewalls can identify known DDoS botnets through IP blackhole lists and immediately discard traffic originating from them. This reduces attack volume but is less effective against changing botnet IP addresses.
DDoS Mitigation Service
A cloud-based scrubbing service can filter out attack traffic and only pass through legitimate user connections. This specialized service shifts attack impact away from the target’s infrastructure.
Strategic Protection Against Ping Floods
Organizations seeking robust protection will need to develop a strategy that incorporates multiple layers:
Maintain patching, gear redundancy, and capacity headroom to tolerate moderate flood volumes.
Implement intelligent rate limiting, protocol blocking, and filtering to minimize attack impact.
Validate DDoS defense readiness through annual stress testing.
Pursue targeted infrastructure upgrades to handle projected traffic growth.
Establish a DDoS emergency response plan, including contracting a cloud-based scrubbing service.
Train IT teams on DDoS monitoring, mitigation techniques, and emergency procedures.
Develop relationships with ISPs to quickly block attack traffic upstream during a DDoS event.
With adequate resources, vigilance, and partnerships, organizations can mitigate the majority of ping flood risks and prevent successful denial of service.
Conclusion
Ping floods represent a serious threat to organizations as one of the most common and disruptive DDoS attack vectors. By overwhelming the target’s network and systems with a tsunami of ICMP echo requests, perpetrators can cut off user access and cause extensive damage within minutes.
Defending against ping floods requires a multi-layer strategy combining intelligent traffic filtering, increased capacity, DDoS mitigation services, and emergency response planning. With protocols and solutions improving each year, organizations have many tools to safeguard infrastructure against even high-volume ICMP floods.

Ping of Death (POD)
173.4k views
DDoS
What is a Ping of Death?
Ping of Death (POD) is a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the fragmentation of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets. By sending malformed or oversized ICMP packets, attackers can crash, freeze, or reboot victims’ systems.
How Does a Ping of Death Attack Work?
The Ping of Death attack involves exploiting the ICMP protocol and IP fragmentation. Here’s a quick overview of how it works:
The attacker sends an ICMP (ping) packet that is larger than the maximum allowed size of 65,535 bytes.
This oversized packet gets fragmented into multiple, smaller packets by the attacker’s system before sending.
The receiving system tries to reassemble these fragments back into the larger packet.
The reassembly process fails because the packet exceeds the maximum size, causing the system to crash or freeze.
The key is that fragmented packets do not contain information about the overall size of the original large packet. So, the receiving system has no way to know if the final reassembled packet will exceed the allowed size until it’s too late.
This attack can be performed using readily available tools and can target various operating systems and devices including routers, firewalls, and servers. Some systems are more vulnerable than others depending on how they handle packet reassembly.
History and Discovery of the Ping of Death
The Ping of Death was first presented in 1996 by a group of security researchers. It gained widespread notoriety when it was used to crash machines running Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems.
At the time, it also affected many router and firewall vendors. The Ping of Death highlighted inherent weaknesses in the TCP/IP suite’s handling of fragmented packets.
After its discovery, the Ping of Death vector was widely shared online and became exploited by attackers to take down victims’ systems. It exemplified the rising threat that denial-of-service and similar attacks posed in the late 1990s as Internet adoption began to grow rapidly.
Preventing Ping of Death Attacks
There are several methods to prevent or mitigate Ping of Death attacks:
Patch Systems
Vendors released patches for operating systems and network devices that implemented better packet reassembly and fragmentation handling. Keeping systems patched and updated is one of the best protections.
Block ICMP at the Firewall
Network perimeter firewalls can be configured to block all incoming ICMP packets to prevent pings from reaching vulnerable systems. However, this can also block legitimate troubleshooting pings.
Reduce Fragmentation
Adjust the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) on networks to reduce the need for fragmentation. Attackers rely on fragmentation to hide the packet sizes.
Intrusion Detection Systems
Network and host-based IDS can detect abnormal fragmentation and block oversized ICMP packets. Signatures can identify Ping of Death and other fragmentation exploits.
Packet Size Validation
Performing checks on packet sizes during reassembly can prevent buffer overflow or errors when the fragments exceed limits. Dropping oversized packets mitigates the risk.
Ping of Death in Cloud Environments
With the widespread adoption of cloud computing and virtualization, Ping of Death has evolved as a threat vector in these environments.
Attacking hypervisors: The virtualization hypervisor that manages guest virtual machines (VMs) can be targeted by sending malformed pings to its management interfaces. This can lead to DoS conditions for multiple hosted VMs.
Cross-VM attacks: Ping packets can be crafted to exploit VM isolation boundaries and impact adjacent VMs hosted on a compromised hypervisor.
Cloud instance flooding: Cloud instances or containers with public IP addresses can be bombarded with high volumes of Ping of Death payloads, consuming resources.
Cloud network saturation: High traffic volumes of large ping packets directed at cloud-based network infrastructure components, like load balancers, can saturate internal bandwidth.
Ongoing Ping of Death Threats
While patches, firewalls, and other measures can prevent Ping of Death attacks, vulnerabilities related to IP fragmentation handling still persist. Some key risks include:
Protocol design flaws: Fundamental IP fragmentation issues enable various fragment manipulation attacks, of which Ping of Death is one type. These flaws cannot be completely patched.
Embedded devices: Many modern embedded systems and IoT devices lack fragmentation handling protections and can be taken down using Ping of Death techniques.
Protocol-aware firewalls: Legacy firewalls without deep packet inspection often fail to detect fragmentation exploits.
IPv6: Expanding IPv6 adoption reopens fragmentation and reassembly vulnerabilities if not implemented properly by vendors.
Overall, Ping of Death represents the ingenuity of attackers to find and leverage low-level protocol weaknesses for malicious purposes.

IP Spoofing
140.8k views
DDoS
Spoofing definition
Spoofing is an impersonation of a user, device or client on the Internet. It’s often used during a cyberattack to disguise the source of attack traffic.
The most common forms of spoofing are:
DNS server spoofing – Modifies a DNS server in order to redirect a domain name to a different IP address. It’s typically used to spread viruses.
ARP spoofing – Links a perpetrator’s MAC address to a legitimate IP address through spoofed ARP messages. It’s typically used in denial of service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle assaults.
IP address spoofing – Disguises an attacker’s origin IP. It’s typically used in DoS assaults.
What is IP address spoofing
Computer networks communicate through the exchange of network data packets, each containing multiple headers used for routing and to ensure transmission continuity. One such header is the ‘Source IP Address’, which indicates the IP address of the packet’s sender.

IP address spoofing is the act of falsifying the content in the Source IP header, usually with randomized numbers, either to mask the sender’s identity or to launch a reflected DDoS attack, as described below. IP spoofing is a default feature in most DDoS malware kits and attack scripts, making it a part of most network layer distributed denial of service DDoS attacks.
IP Address spoofing in DDoS attacks
IP address spoofing is used for two reasons in DDoS attacks: to mask botnet device locations and to stage a reflected assault.
Masking botnet devices
A botnet is a cluster of malware-infected devices remotely controlled by perpetrators without the knowledge of their owners. They can be instructed to collectively access a given domain or server, providing perpetrators with the computing and networking resources to generate huge traffic floods. Such floods enable botnet operators, (a.k.a. shepherds), to max out their target’s resource capacity, resulting in server downtime and network saturation.
Botnets are typically comprised of either random, geographically dispersed devices, or computers belonging to the same compromised network (e.g., hacked hosting platform).
By using spoofed IP addresses to mask the true identities of their botnet devices, perpetrators aim to:
1.Avoid discovery and implication by law enforcement and forensic cyber-investigators.
2.Prevent targets from notifying device owners about an attack in which they are unwittingly participating.
3.Bypass security scripts, devices and services that attempt to mitigate DDoS attacks through the blacklisting of attacking IP addresses.
Reflected DDoS
A reflected DDoS attack uses IP spoofing to generate fake requests, ostensibly on behalf of a target, to elicit responses from under protected intermediary servers. The perpetrator’s goal is to amplify their traffic output by triggering large responses from much smaller requests.
Common reflected DDoS attack methods include:
DNS amplification – An ANY query originating from a target’s spoofed address is sent to numerous unsecured DNS resolvers. Each 60 byte request can prompt a 4000 byte response, enabling attackers to magnify traffic output by as much as 1:70.
Smurf attack – An ICMP Echo request is sent from a target’s spoofed address to an intermediate broadcast network, triggering replies from every device on that network. The degree of amplification is based on the number of devices to which the request is broadcast. For example, a network with 50 connected hosts results in a 1:50 amplification.
NTP amplification – A get monlist request, containing a target’s spoofed IP address, is sent to an unsecure NTP server. As in DNS amplification, a small request triggers a much larger response, allowing a maximum amplification ratio of 1:200.
IP address spoofing in application layer attacks
For application layer connections to be established, the host and visitor are required to engage in a process of mutual verification, known as a TCP three-way handshake.
The process consists of the following exchange of synchronization (SYN) and acknowledgement (ACK) packets:
1.Visitor sends a SYN packet to a host.
2.Host replies with a SYN-ACK.
3.Visitor acknowledges receipt of the SYN-ACK by replying with an ACK packet.
Source IP spoofing makes the third step of this process impossible, as it prohibits the visitor from ever receiving the SYN-ACK reply, which is sent to the spoofed IP address.
Since all application layer attacks rely on TCP connections and the closure of the 3-way handshake loop, only network layer DDoS attacks can use spoofed addresses.
IP address spoofing in security research
In security research, IP data derived from network layer assaults is often used to identify the country of origin of attacker resources. IP address spoofing, however, makes this data unreliable, as both the IP address and geolocation of malicious traffic is masked.
When reading reports relying solely on network IP data, it’s necessary to be aware of these limitations. For example, a report by a mitigation provider that doesn’t protect against application layer attacks can’t be relied on to provide accurate locations of botnet devices.
As a result, any substantial research into botnet countries of origin can only be based on application layer attack data.
See how Imperva DDoS Protection can help you with IP spoofing.
Request demoLearn more
Anti-spoofing in DDoS protection
As mentioned, IP address spoofing is commonly used to bypass basic security measures that rely on IP blacklisting— the blocking of addresses known to have been previously involved in an attack.
To overcome this, modern mitigation solutions rely on deep packet inspection (DPI), which uses granular analysis of all packet headers rather than just source IP address. With DPI, mitigation solutions are able to cross-examine the content of different packet headers to uncover other metrics to identify and filter out malicious traffic.
For example, a mitigation service can employ DPI to observe a DDoS traffic stream and identify an influx of packets with suspiciously-identical TTLs and Total Length headers that don’t match a normal pattern. By tracking such small abnormalities, the service can create a granular profile of an attacking packet and use it to weed out malicious traffic without impacting regular visitor flow.
The downside of DPI is that the process is very resource intensive. When performed on scale, such as during a DDoS attack, DPI is likely to cause performance degradation—sometimes even making the protected network almost completely unresponsive.
To overcome this, Imperva scrubbing is performed by a purpose-built mitigation hardware (codename Behemoth) that runs DPI against ~100 million packets per second.

A cluster of Behemoth scrubbers mitigates a 470 Gbps DDoS attack—one of the largest on record.
Built from the ground up, every Behemoth scrubber provides granular visibility of all incoming data, thus ensuring that attack traffic never enters your network. Meanwhile, your valid visitor traffic flows through unimpeded.

ser datagram protocol (UDP)
133.5k views
DDoS
What is user datagram protocol (UDP)
User datagram protocol (UDP) operates on top of the Internet Protocol (IP) to transmit datagrams over a network. UDP does not require the source and destination to establish a three-way handshake before transmission takes place. Additionally, there is no need for an end-to-end connection.
Since UDP avoids the overhead associated with connections, error checks and the retransmission of missing data, it’s suitable for real-time or high performance applications that don’t require data verification or correction. If verification is needed, it can be performed at the application layer.
UDP is commonly used for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) applications, although RPC can also run on top of TCP. RPC applications need to be aware they are running on UDP, and must then implement their own reliability mechanisms.
The benefits and downsides of UDP
UDP has a number of benefits for different types of applications, including:
No retransmission delays – UDP is suitable for time-sensitive applications that can’t afford retransmission delays for dropped packets. Examples include Voice over IP (VoIP), online games, and media streaming.
Speed – UDP’s speed makes it useful for query-response protocols such as DNS, in which data packets are small and transactional.
Suitable for broadcasts – UDP’s lack of end-to-end communication makes it suitable for broadcasts, in which transmitted data packets are addressed as receivable by all devices on the internet. UDP broadcasts can be received by large numbers of clients without server-side overhead.
At the same time, UDP’s lack of connection requirements and data verification can create a number of issues when transmitting packets. These include:
No guaranteed ordering of packets.
No verification of the readiness of the computer receiving the message.
No protection against duplicate packets.
No guarantee the destination will receive all transmitted bytes. UDP, however, does provide a checksum to verify individual packet integrity.
UDP header packet structure
UDP wraps datagrams with a UDP header, which contains four fields totaling eight bytes.
The fields in a UDP header are:

oSource port – The port of the device sending the data. This field can be set to zero if the destination computer doesn’t need to reply to the sender.
oDestination port – The port of the device receiving the data. UDP port numbers can be between 0 and 65,535.
oLength – Specifies the number of bytes comprising the UDP header and the UDP payload data. The limit for the UDP length field is determined by the underlying IP protocol used to transmit the data.
oChecksum – The checksum allows the receiving device to verify the integrity of the packet header and payload. It is optional in IPv4 but was made mandatory in IPv6.

The fields in a UDP header
UDP DDoS threats and vulnerabilities
UDP’s lack of a verification mechanism and end-to-end connections makes it vulnerable to a number of DDoS attacks. Attackers can spoof packets with arbitrary IP addresses, and reach the application directly with those packets.
This is in contrast to TCP, in which a sender must receive packets back from the receiver before communication can start.
UDP specific DDoS attacks include:
UDP Flood
A UDP flood involves large volumes of spoofed UDP packets being sent to multiple ports on a single server, knowing that there is no way to verify the real source of the packets. The server responds to all the requests with ICMP ‘Destination Unreachable’ messages, overwhelming its resources.
In addition to the traditional UDP flood, DDoS perpetrators often stage generic network layer attacks by sending mass amounts of fake UDP packets to create network congestion. These attacks can only be mitigated by scaling up a network’s resources on demand, as is done when using a cloud DDoS mitigation solution.
DNS Amplification
A DNS amplification attack involves a perpetrator sending UDP packets with a spoofed IP address, which corresponds to the IP of the victim, to its DNS resolvers. The DNS resolvers then send their response to the victim. The attack is crafted such that the DNS response is much larger than the original request, which creates amplification of the original attack.
When done on a large scale with many clients and multiple DNS resolvers, it can overwhelm the target system. A DDoS attack with capacity of 27Gbps can be amplified to as much as 300Gbps using amplification.
UDP Port Scan
Attackers send UDP packets to ports on a server to determine which ports are open. If a server responds with an ICMP ‘Destination Unreachable’ message, the port is not open. If there is no such response, the attacker infers that the port is open, and then use this information to plan an attack on the system.

Botnet DDoS Attacks
130.4k views
DDoS
What is a botnet?
Occasionally referred to as a “zombie army,” a botnet is a group of hijacked Internet-connected devices, each injected with malware used to control it from a remote location without the knowledge of the device’s rightful owner. From the point of view of hackers, these botnet devices are computing resources that can be used for any type of malicious purposes—most commonly for spam or DDoS attacks.
An individual botnet device can be simultaneously compromised by several perpetrators, each using it for a different type of attack and often at the same time. For instance, a malware-infected personal computer could be ordered to rapidly access a website as part of a larger DDoS attack. At the same time it could also be performing vulnerability scans, with its owner browsing the web—unaware of both occurrences.
“We have a Botnet army ready to take down your site. You have 48 hours to pay us 1200$. Merry Xmas!” – DDoS ransom note
What is a DDoS attack?
DDoS is an acronym for distributed denial of service. A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to make a server or a network resource unavailable to users. It is achieved by saturating a service, which results in its temporary suspension or interruption.
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack involves a single machine used to either target a software vulnerability or flood a targeted resource with packets, requests or queries. A DDoS attack, however, uses multiple connected devices—often executed by botnets or, on occasion, by individuals who have coordinated their activity.
DDoS attacks can be divided into two general categories:
1. Application layer DDoS attack types include HTTP floods, slow attacks (Slowloris, RUDY), zero-day assaults, and those targeting vulnerabilities in operation systems, web applications and communication protocols.
Comprised of seemingly legitimate and innocent requests, their magnitude usually being measured in requests per second (RPS), the goal of the attacks is to overwhelm a target application with requests. This causes high CPU and memory usage that eventually hangs or crashes the application.
2. Network layer DDoS attack types include UDP floods, SYN floods, NTP amplification, DNS amplification, SSDP amplification, IP fragmentation and more.
These are high-capacity barrages, measured in gigabits per second (Gbps) or packets per second (PPS). They’re almost always executed by botnets, with a goal of consuming the target’s upstream bandwidth, resulting in network saturation.
It should be noted that DDoS attacks can also target supporting infrastructures and services—most commonly the target’s DNS servers. These can be over-encumbered with a flood of fabricated DNS requests, originating from botnet devices.
DDoS botnet and botnet tools
The originator of a botnet is commonly referred to as a “bot herder,” or “botmaster.” This individual controls the botnet remotely, often through intermediate machines known as the command and control (C&C, or C2) servers.
To communicate with a C&C server, the botmaster uses various hidden channels, including seemingly innocuous protocols like IRC and HTTP websites, as well as popular services like Twitter, Facebook and even Reddit.
Botnet servers are able to communicate and cooperate with other botnet servers, effectively creating a P2P network controlled by a single or multiple botmasters. This means that any given botnet DDoS attack may have multiple origins, or be controlled by multiple individuals—sometimes working in a coordinated manner, other times operating independently.
Botnets-for-hire are available from various sources, their services often being auctioned and traded among attackers. Online marketplaces have even sprung up—these are commercial entities trading in huge numbers of malware-infected PCs. They can be rented and used for DDoS or other attacks (e.g., brute force).
 Typical DDoS stresser price list
These platforms, often hiding behind the ambiguous service definition of stressers, or booters, sell DDoS-as-a-service. They provide their clients with a richly-featured toolkit, as well as a distribution network, so as to execute their attacks on call.
Now armed with a rented botnet, DDoS attacks have become a viable (if criminal) and cost-effective option for anyone looking to take out a website or disturb communication of home and office networks. This results in a number of attack scenarios, ranging from shady businesses using DDoS to gain a competitive advantage to assaults in which DDoS becomes a tool of vandalism, revenge or simply a way to get some attention.
Full-service DDoS attacks are available for as little as $5 per hour, and the interested party can easily stretch their hour with a monthly plan that averages $38. Within the cybercrime ecosystem, botnet DDoS attacks are a mainstream commodity; prices continually drop, while efficacy and sophistication is constantly on the rise.
Known botnets
Botnets are typically named after malware kits used in their creation. However, since botnet herders operate in anonymity, not all such kits are identifiable. Some of the most commonly used DDoS botnets are:
Nitol / IMDDOS / Avzhan / ChinaZ
This is an evolving DDoS botnet family that periodically morphs. It mostly operates in China. Once installed, its malware usually connects to the botnet’s C&C server using a TCP socket and then sends performance information from the victim’s machine.
Microsoft security researchers discovered in 2012 that Nitol-infected PCs were being sold in China on a mass scale; each device had a counterfeit Windows OS installed. Three years later, an Imperva report showed Nitol to be the most widely-spread botnet, infected machines accounting for 59.2 percent of all attacking botnet IPs.
MrBlack
Also known as Trojan.Linux.Spike.A, this malware targets the Linux platform, but is also available for various architectures and platforms (most commonly SOHO routers). It contacts a remote server, sending system information. Moreover, it receives control commands to perform different types of DDoS attacks against a given target, download a file and execute it, and then terminate a process.
In May 2015 a large-scale router-based, MrBlack botnet revealed itself, after taking part in mass-scale attacks against Imperva clients.
Cyclone
This is DDoS malware created in the U.S. It’s IRC-based and its C&C details are obfuscated. It’s known to kill off other bots on an infected host, in addition to stealing FTP credentials from Filezilla. Attacks include multiple HTTP floods, SlowLoris (though not slow), and ARME (Apache remote memory exhaustion).
Pushdo / Cutwail
Founded around 2007, Cutwail is a botnet mostly involved in sending spam e-mails. The bot typically infects computers running Microsoft Windows by way of a Trojan component called Pushdo.
Early in 2010 the botnetʼs activities were slightly altered when it was used in DDoS attacks against 300 major sites—including the CIA, FBI, Twitter and PayPal.
A 2015 report showed the Pushdo botnet affecting computer users in over 50 different countries—mainly India, Indonesia, Turkey and Vietnam.

What is Slowloris?
Slowloris is basically an HTTP Denial of Service attack that affects threaded servers. It works like this:
1.We start making lots of HTTP requests.
2.We send headers periodically (every ~15 seconds) to keep the connections open.
3.We never close the connection unless the server does so. If the server closes a connection, we create a new one keep doing the same thing.
This exhausts the servers thread pool and the server can't reply to other people.

However, if you plan on using the -x option in order to use a SOCKS5 proxy for connecting instead of a direct connection over your IP address, you will need to install the PySocks library (or any other implementation of the socks library) as well. PySocks is a fork from SocksiPy by GitHub user @Anorov and can easily be installed by adding PySocks to the pip command above or running it again like so:
sudo pip3 install PySocks
You can then use the -x option to activate SOCKS5 support and the --proxy-host and --proxy-port option to specify the SOCKS5 proxy host and its port, if they are different from the standard 127.0.0.1:8080.

What is a Slowloris DDoS attack?
Slowloris is a denial-of-service attack program which allows an attacker to overwhelm a targeted server by opening and maintaining many simultaneous HTTP connections between the attacker and the target.

How does a Slowloris attack work?
Slowloris is an application layer attack which operates by utilizing partial HTTP requests. The attack functions by opening connections to a targeted Web server and then keeping those connections open as long as it can.
Slowloris is not a category of attack but is instead a specific attack tool designed to allow a single machine to take down a server without using a lot of bandwidth. Unlike bandwidth-consuming reflection-based DDoS attacks such as NTP amplification, this type of attack uses a low amount of bandwidth, and instead aims to use up server resources with requests that seem slower than normal but otherwise mimic regular traffic. It falls in the category of attacks known as “low and slow” attacks. The targeted server will only have so many threads available to handle concurrent connections. Each server thread will attempt to stay alive while waiting for the slow request to complete, which never occurs. When the server’s maximum possible connections has been exceeded, each additional connection will not be answered and denial-of-service will occur.
A Slowloris attack occurs in 4 steps:
1.The attacker first opens multiple connections to the targeted server by sending multiple partial HTTP request headers.
2.The target opens a thread for each incoming request, with the intent of closing the thread once the connection is completed. In order to be efficient, if a connection takes too long, the server will timeout the exceedingly long connection, freeing the thread up for the next request.
3.To prevent the target from timing out the connections, the attacker periodically sends partial request headers to the target in order to keep the request alive. In essence saying, “I’m still here! I’m just slow, please wait for me.”
4.The targeted server is never able to release any of the open partial connections while waiting for the termination of the request. Once all available threads are in use, the server will be unable to respond to additional requests made from regular traffic, resulting in denial-of-service.
The key behind a Slowloris is its ability to cause a lot of trouble with very little bandwidth consumption.
How is a Slowloris attack mitigated?
For web servers that are vulnerable to Slowloris, there are ways to mitigate some of the impact. Mitigation options for vulnerable servers can be broken down into 3 general categories:
1.Increase server availability - Increasing the maximum number of clients the server will allow at any one time will increase the number of connections the attacker must make before they can overload the server. Realistically, an attacker may scale the number of attacks to overcome server capacity regardless of increases.
2.Rate limit incoming requests - Restricting access based on certain usage factors will help mitigate a Slowloris attack. Techniques such as limiting the maximum number of connections a single IP address is allowed to make, restricting slow transfer speeds, and limiting the maximum time a client is allowed to stay connected are all approaches for limiting the effectiveness of low and slow attacks.
3.Cloud-based protection - Use a service that can function as a reverse proxy, protecting the origin server.
How does Cloudflare mitigate a Slowloris attack?
Cloudflare buffers incoming requests before starting to send anything to the origin server. As a result, “low and slow” attack traffic like Slowloris attacks never reach the intended target. Learn more about how Cloudflare's DDoS protection stops slowloris attacks.

Download: https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/http-slowloris-check.nse
Script Summary
Tests a web server for vulnerability to the Slowloris DoS attack without actually launching a DoS attack.
Slowloris was described at Defcon 17 by RSnake (see http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/).
This script opens two connections to the server, each without the final CRLF. After 10 seconds, second connection sends additional header. Both connections then wait for server timeout. If second connection gets a timeout 10 or more seconds after the first one, we can conclude that sending additional header prolonged its timeout and that the server is vulnerable to slowloris DoS attack.
A "LIKELY VULNERABLE" result means a server is subject to timeout-extension attack, but depending on the http server's architecture and resource limits, a full denial-of-service is not always possible. Complete testing requires triggering the actual DoS condition and measuring server responsiveness.
You can specify custom http User-agent field with http.useragent script argument.

Script Summary
Tests a web server for vulnerability to the Slowloris DoS attack by launching a Slowloris attack.
Slowloris was described at Defcon 17 by RSnake (see http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/).
This script opens and maintains numerous 'half-HTTP' connections until the server runs out of resources, leading to a denial of service. When a successful DoS is detected, the script stops the attack and returns these pieces of information (which may be useful to tweak further filtering rules):
Time taken until DoS
Number of sockets used
Number of queries sent
By default the script runs for 30 minutes if DoS is not achieved.
Please note that the number of concurrent connexions must be defined with the --max-parallelism option (default is 20, suggested is 400 or more) Also, be advised that in some cases this attack can bring the web server down for good, not only while the attack is running.
Also, due to OS limitations, the script is unlikely to work when run from Windows.

Hello fellas, this is my first thread where I will show you T50 one powerful tool that can send lot of packets (tested on my own server and hitting fine).
First you can download T50 here 422.
If you want to run a stress test, run t50 (IP) -flood -S(this is protocol)(optional --turbo) in a terminal. Also, there are many other options you can find if you use the --help flag.
T50 has really good performance. If you want to stress-test severs that are not connected on LAN, you have to port forward.
The reason why I want to share is because I tried with many other tools but they do not compare with T50.
Don’t forget to use it only for educational purposes, because there’s a lot of people who are running it just for fun and even without proxychain.
I forgot to mention something: Many people think ufonet is a better choice if you want to have free botnet, but I don’t think this is true. Since it seems to good to be true, I believe it might infect your machine (even if you use a VM), so you probably will become one of those zombies. 


NS-2 and NS-3 are popular network simulation tools used for modeling and simulating communication networks. Here's an overview of these tools, including their characteristics, development timelines, defense methods, and technologies used:

**NS-2 (Network Simulator 2):**
- **Characteristics:** NS-2 is an open-source discrete event network simulator that allows users to simulate a wide range of network protocols and scenarios. It provides a modular and extensible framework for simulating wired and wireless networks, routing protocols, and transport protocols. NS-2 is widely used for research, education, and network protocol development.

- **Development Timeline:** NS-2 was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with ongoing updates and contributions from the networking research community.

- **Defense Methods:** NS-2 itself is not a tool used for network defense against cyber attacks. Instead, it is primarily used for research, testing, and development of network protocols and technologies.

- **Technologies Used:** NS-2 supports a wide range of networking technologies, including wired and wireless networks, various routing protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP, OSPF, and others), mobility models, and traffic generators.

**NS-3 (Network Simulator 3):**
- **Characteristics:** NS-3 is a discrete-event network simulator that provides a modular and flexible platform for simulating communication networks. It is designed to support the development and testing of new networking protocols, algorithms, and technologies. NS-3 is known for its extensibility and support for a wide range of network scenarios and protocols.

- **Development Timeline:** NS-3 was developed as a successor to NS-2 and was first released in the late 2000s. Since then, it has continued to evolve with contributions from the networking research and development community.

- **Defense Methods:** Similar to NS-2, NS-3 is not a tool used for network defense against cyber attacks. Instead, it is primarily used for research, testing, and development of network protocols and technologies.

- **Technologies Used:** NS-3 supports a variety of networking technologies, including wired and wireless networks, Internet protocols, mobility models, and traffic control mechanisms. It also allows for the development and integration of custom protocols and models.

Both NS-2 and NS-3 are valuable tools for network simulation and research, enabling users to model and evaluate the performance of different network configurations, protocols, and technologies. While they are not used for network defense against cyber attacks, the insights gained from simulations using these tools can inform the development of more robust and secure network architectures and protocols.

The difference between ns-2 and ns-3
ns-2 is a popular discrete-event network simulator developed under several previous research grants and activities. It remains in active use and will continue to be maintained.
ns-3 is a new software development effort focused on improving upon the core architecture, software integration, models, and educational components of ns-2. The project commenced in July 2006 and the first release was made on June 30, 2008.
ns-2 scripts in ns-3
ns-2 scripts will not run within ns-3. ns-2 uses OTcl as its scripting environment. ns-3 uses C++ programs or python scripts to define simulations.
ns-2 models in ns-3
Some ns-2 models that are mostly written in C++ have already been ported to ns-3: OLSR and Error Model were originally written for ns-2. OTcl-based models have not been and will not be ported since this would be equivalent to a complete rewrite.





Hyperscan
-https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3323234.3323286
Regular expression matching serves as a key functionality of modern network security applications. Unfortunately, it often becomes the performance bottleneck as it involves compute-intensive scan of every byte of packet payload. With trends towards increasing network bandwidth and a large ruleset of complex patterns, the performance requirement gets ever more demanding.
In this paper, we present Hyperscan, a high performance regular expression matcher for commodity server machines. Hyperscan employs two core techniques for efficient pattern matching. First, it exploits graph decomposition that translates regular expression matching into a series of string and finite automata matching. Unlike existing solutions, string matching becomes a part of regular expression matching, eliminating duplicate operations. Decomposed regular expression components also increase the chance of fast DFA matching as they tend to be smaller than the original pattern. Second, Hyperscan accelerates both string and finite automata matching using SIMD operations, which brings substantial throughput improvement. Our evaluation shows that Hyperscan improves the performance of Snort by a factor of 8.7 for a real traffic trace.

Hyperscan is a high performance regular expression matching library from Intel that runs on x86 platforms and offers support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) syntax, simultaneous matching of groups of regular expressions, and streaming operations. It is released as open source software under a BSD license. Hyperscan presents a flexible C API and a number of different modes of operation to ensure its applicability in real networking scenarios. Moreover, a focus on efficient algorithms and the use of Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions (Intel® SSE) enables Hyperscan to achieve high matching performance. It is suitable for usage scenarios such as deep packet inspection (DPI), intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), and firewalls, and has been deployed in network security solutions worldwide. Hyperscan has also been integrated into widely used open-source IDS and IPS products like Snort* and Suricata*.
An open source version of the library is available at https://github.com/intel/hyperscan. Intel has an upgraded library version that is available through your Intel sales representative.
Under the Hood
Hyperscan’s workflow can be divided into two parts: compile time and run-time.
Compile time
Hyperscan comes with a regular expression compiler written in C++. As shown in Figure 1, it takes regular expressions as input. Depending on the Intel® architecture platform features available, user-defined modes and pattern features, Hyperscan generates a corresponding pattern database through a complex graph analysis and optimization process. The generated database can also be serialized and stored in memory for later use by the runtime.

Figure 1: Hyperscan compilation process

Figure 2: Hyperscan run-time
Run-time
The Hyperscan run-time is developed in C. Figure 2 shows a high-level block diagram of the main components of the run-time. You need to pre-allocate a scratch space for temporary information used during scanning, and then use the compiled database to call Hyperscan's scan APIs to trigger internal matching engines (nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and so on) to match the corpus. Hyperscan accelerates these engines with the help of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) instructions provided by the Intel processor, and matches are delivered to the user application for processing via a user-provided callback function. Since the Hyperscan pattern database is read-only, users can share the database between multiple CPU cores or multiple threads to enhance matching scalability.
Features
Versatile Functionality
Hyperscan supports cross-compilation for multiple Intel processors, with specific optimizations for different instruction sets. It has no operating system restrictions, supports both virtual machine and container scenarios, covers most PCRE syntax, and supports complex expressions that include syntaxes such as ". *" and "[^>] *". Different modes of operation (streaming, block, and vectored) are available to meet the requirements of different scenarios. If requested through the use of a per-pattern flag, Hyperscan can find the starting and ending positions of the matching data in the input stream. For more information, see the current version of the Hyperscan Developer Reference Guide.
Large-scale Matching
Depending on complexity, Hyperscan can support matching a large set of rules. Unlike most regular matching engines, Hyperscan supports multi-pattern matching. After you specify a unique ID for each rule, Hyperscan is able to compile the rules into a database and output all the current matching rule IDs during the matching process.

Figure 3: Data scattered in different units in time order
Streaming mode
Hyperscan supports three modes of operation: block mode, streaming mode, and vectored mode. Block mode is the most straightforward, where a single contiguous block of data is scanned, with matches returned to the caller as they are found. Streaming mode is designed for cross-packet matching in networking scenarios where the data to be scanned is broken up into multiple packets. In streaming mode, Hyperscan can save the match state for the current data block and use it as the initial match state when a new data block arrives. As shown in Figure 3, streaming mode guarantees the consistency of the final matches regardless of how the “xxxxabcxxxxxxxdefx“ data is split into packets over time. In addition, Hyperscan can compress the saved match state to reduce the application’s memory footprint. Streaming mode operation provides a simple way to scan data that arrives over a period of time without requiring you to buffer and rescan packets or limit scanning to a fixed window of historical data. Finally, there is vectored mode, which offers scanning in sequence of a set of data blocks that are not contiguous in memory.
High Performance and Scalability
Hyperscan requires the Intel® Streaming SIMD Extensions 3 instruction set at a minimum and makes use of SIMD instructions to accelerate matching performance. Below, we provide a brief summary of a publicly-available performance demo, Performance Analysis of Hyperscan with hsbench.
We use three different pattern sets for this analysis.
Snort Literals is a set of 3,316 literal patterns extracted from the sample ruleset included with the Snort* 3 network intrusion detection system.
Snort PCREs is a set of 847 regular expressions that was also extracted from the sample ruleset that includes Snort 3, taken from rules targeted at HTTP traffic.
Teakettle 2500 is a set of 2,500 synthetic patterns generated with a script that produces regular expressions of limited complexity. We tested these pattern sets on alexa200.db, a large traffic sample constructed from a PCAP capture of an automated Web browser browsing a subset of the top sites listed on Alexa*.
These pattern sets and corpora are available at https://01.org/blogs/jpviiret/2017/performance-analysis-hyperscan-hsbench.
Figure 4 shows Hyperscan's matching performance (Gbps) in block mode on the Intel® Xeon® processor E5-2699 v4 @ 2.20 GHz.

Figure 4: Hyperscan performance in block mode on different rule sets.
Figure 4 shows that Hyperscan can achieve good single core performance using different rule sets. Moreover, it has high scalability, in which its matching performance grows almost linearly as the number of cores in use increases.
Integration of Hyperscan and the DPDK

Figure 5: Performance of Hyperscan and Data Plane Development Kit integration
The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) enables high speed network packet processing and forwarding, and is widely applied in the industry. Hyperscan and DPDK can be integrated into a high-performance DPI solution. Figure 5 shows the performance data of the integrated solution. In the test, we used real patterns and HTTP traffic as input. The integration of Hyperscan and DPDK delivers high performance, and at larger packets sizes the performance can reach wire speed in this test.
Summary
Hyperscan provides a flexible, easy to use library that enables you to match large numbers of patterns simultaneously with high performance and good scalability, as well as providing unique functionality for network packets processing. The integration of Hyperscan and the DPDK also provides mature and efficient solutions for DPI, IDS, IPS and other related products.

SSO
https://frontegg.com/guides/single-sign-on-sso
What is Single Sign-On (SSO) and How Does it Work?
What Is SSO (Single Sign-On)?
Single Sign-On (SSO) is a protocol used to authenticate and authorize users to multiple applications using a single set of credentials. SSO is very convenient for users because they don’t need to memorize multiple passwords and don’t need to perform multiple login operations. When implemented correctly, Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions also improve security and reduce risks created by weak, repeated, or lost passwords.

Modern identity and access management (IAM) solutions can help enterprises implement SSO for multiple applications under their control. Open standards like OAuth 2.0 and OIDC can help users authenticate for applications via any identity provider, even external to the organization. Modern SSO leverages social login, where users can access applications using their existing credentials for services like Google, Facebook, or Twitter.
If you are building a new application or a cloud-based system, SSO should be an important consideration. SSO dramatically simplifies usage and improves the user experience. Even more importantly, it enhances security by standardizing authentication and giving users only one password instead of several. 
This is part of an extensive series of guides about Access Management.

9 Benefits of SSO
The key benefits of single sign-on are:
1.Reduced Password fatigue: This is achieved by reducing the need to remember different usernames and passwords.
2.Faster logins: Users can log in faster thanks to the reduced times needed to re-enter passwords whenever the same user logs in.
3.Less Third-party risk: SSO mitigates risks associated with accessing third-party websites (i.e., federated authentication) and avoiding the external storage and management of user passwords.
4.Lowered IT costs: There is a big drop in the number of password reset and signing in calls to the IT help desk, thus lowering costs.
5.Simple admin: SSO processes are transparent and involve the same tools used for other admin tasks. 
6.Added Control: All network management data is in one repository, providing a unified source to control user privileges. Admins can easily modify access privileges throughout the network. 
7.More Productivity: Users avoid disruptions and delays due to multiple logins or managing multiple passwords. They can access protected network areas easily and get back to work immediately. 
8.Better Network security: Complex password management is a common cause of security breaches because users often write down the passwords. By consolidating the network access data, admins can confidently disable user accounts. 
9.Network consolidation: Admins can connect separate networks to consolidate their management efforts and oversee all diverse, distributed environments. 
Types of SSO
When identifying and operating SSO, you need to be aware of the different protocols and standards. These include:
Security Access Markup Language (SAML)
SAML is an open standard for encoding text into machine language and exchanging identifying information. It has become one of the core standards for SSO and is used by many application providers to validate authentication requests. SAML 2.0 is optimized for web applications and can send information through a web browser.
Open Authorization (OAuth)
OAuth is an open standard authentication protocol that encrypts identity information and transmits it securely between applications. This allows users to access data from other applications without having to manually verify their identity. This is especially useful for native mobile applications.
OpenID Connect (OIDC)
OIDC is an extension of OAuth 2.0, which adds information about users and enables SSO. This allows multiple applications to use one login session. For example, users can log into a service using their Facebook or Google account instead of entering their credentials.
Kerberos
Kerberos is a ticket-granting protocol that allows mutual authentication, enabling a user and a server to authenticate each other over an insecure network connection. It is commonly used for authentication in Windows environments and for software applications like email clients.
Physical token authentication
In addition to traditional SSO, many organizations use physical tokens to allow users to securely connect to applications. The token typically requires the user to input a PIN, to enable two-factor authentication. Software on the computer interacts with the encryption key on the smart card to authenticate the user. Smart cards are considered very secure, but they can still be obtained by attackers (for example, if the user loses the card), and are expensive to deploy.
Learn more about SSO providers that implement one or more of these standards:
SSO Providers
Okta SSO
SSO with Azure AD
How Does Single Sign-on Work?
To make SSO possible, an identity provider (IdP) must provide a central authentication server, which multiple applications can use to verify user identities. The authentication server validates user identities and confirms their identity to the application by providing an encrypted access token.
When a user first logs into an application, they are redirected to the IdP and are asked to provide their credentials, typically username and password. 
For example, when signing in to Asana, users can use two different identity providers to login: Asana user name or Google. When users select one of the options, they are redirected to the relevant IdP to perform authentication.
Asana
The authentication server checks the user’s credentials against its central user directory, and if they are valid, starts an SSO session. Subsequently, the user can access the application for a predetermined period without logging in again. 
When the user attempts to access another application from the trusted group, there is no need to request credentials again. The application requests authentication from the IdP, leveraging the open SSO session. The IdP provides an access token, and the application grants access to the user without showing the login screen again. 

Here is an example of an SSO workflow:
1.The user requests a resource from their desired application/website.
2.The application/website redirects the user to the Identity Provider for authentication, using SAML, OpenID Connect, etc.
3.The IdP authenticates the user and passes a token to the SSO server.
4.The SSO server delivers the token to the application.
5.The application grants access to the user.
Now, the user can access all other applications which are configured for SSO. If the user wants to access a resource from another application, that application checks if they have an active SSO session, and if so, uses the same token to grant access.

How Secure Is SSO?
Single sign-on is not a perfect solution for all use cases. Some SSO implementation challenges include managing costs, standardization (OAuth or SAML), control, and security. Authentication vulnerabilities (i.e., the “Sign In with Apple” and Microsoft OAuth flaws) allow attackers to sign into a web service or site, posing as the target user. 
It’s also important to consider how SSO platforms integrate into an organization’s overall IT architecture. Organizations must carefully configure their SSO solutions to maintain their security posture. In some cases, SSO systems block the ability of security solutions to detect a user’s origin IP address when attempting to log in to the system. 
On the other hand, single sign-on can provide stronger security than some alternatives used to control access to an organization’s services. For example, some companies require users to keep separate logins for each service, introducing other security issues. 
SSO helps reduce the IT infrastructure’s attack surface. Users don’t have to remember multiple passwords, and they don’t have to enter credentials several times a day. The centralized admin approach allows administrators to implement stronger security measures like MFA and good password practices. SSO does not make the infrastructure less secure and often helps increase security.
Implementing SSO In 5 Steps
SSO implementation revolves around a central server. All applications trust this master server and use it to access login credentials. If your organization has multiple applications, they probably run on different servers, using different user directories and authentication mechanisms. For single sign-on to work, you must integrate all your applications with the central SSO server. 
Follow these steps to implement SSO authentication in your organization.
1. Map Out The Applications You Want to Connect to SSO
Identify which applications should be part of your SSO structure. Look at user login patterns and identify which users need to access which applications. Create SSO “bundles” for each set of applications commonly accessed by a group of users. See if your SSO solution has built-in integrations with them. If not, prepare development resources to build an integration. 
2. Integrate With Identity Provider (IdP)
If you have your own identity provider, ensure the SSO solution can integrate and test the integration. Determine the protocol you will use to connect to the IdP, typically Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). Otherwise, see which external IdPs your SSO solution supports—social login via platforms like Google or Facebook is commonly used and is convenient for most users. 
3. Verify The Data in Your Identity Directory
For SSO to work, you must have accurate, authoritative information about your users. It is also critical for identities in your IdP to match up with identities used in applications connected via SSO. Ensure that each user in your user database has an up-to-date email and credentials. The data verification process is also an opportunity to remove old users and revoke unnecessary privileges.
4. Evaluate User Privileges
Before implementing SSO, carefully evaluate which users or roles have access to which applications. Most organizations adopt the least-privilege principle, where each user receives the minimal privileges they need to perform their function. Ensure you define privileges carefully, based on a solid understanding of the business uses of each application.
5. Ensure The SSO System is Highly Available Secure
SSO is a mission-critical service and a single point of failure for your applications. If you are running the SSO server on-premises, you must set up redundancy and ensure the server has appropriate network and application layer security controls. If you are using a cloud service, see what reliability or availability tiers it offers, and select the most suitable for your organization. Ensure you have correctly configured the provider’s security options.

SSO Deep Dive: Understanding Common SSO Protocols
SAML and WS-Federation
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and Web Services Federation (WS-Fed) are common options for implementing SSO. These protocols use XML files to exchange data about the user, the IdP, and the application (known as the service provider).
Connection Flow
1.A user requests to access a resource in an application (service provider) that participates in SSO
2.The application checks with the IdP to see if the user is permitted to access the required resource.
3.The IdP authenticates the user, and if the user has access, returns an assertion that the user should be able to access the resource.
SAML Use Cases
Using SAML for SSO—SAML can enable SSO transactions. A SAML service can provide requests to access secure resources, including an authentication element and attributes providing data about the user.
Using SAML for ACL—SAML can be used to enforce access control lists (ACL). SAML can support ACL transactions, in which a user requests to access a secure resource, and the SAML service provides an authorization decision. This use case typically does not include authentication.
OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication and authorization protocol used for customer-facing single sign-on, based on the OAuth 2.0 authorization standard. OIDC performs authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and integrates with one or more identity providers.
Connection Flow
1.A user requests access to an application.
2.The application redirects the request to the identity provider.
3.The IdP authenticates the user. If authentication is successful, the IdP displays a prompt asking the user to grant access to the required application.
4.The IdP generates an ID Token with identity information that the application can use.
5.The IdP redirects the user back to the application, and the user can access it without providing credentials again.
OpenID Connect Use Cases
OIDC supports both secure authentication and authorization, as well as API access. There are three main flows you can use for different use cases:
Implicit—mainly used for single-page applications. Tokens are granted directly to the application (relying party) via a redirect.
Authorization Code—mainly used for native apps, single-page apps, and mobile web apps. This flow is suitable for applications that cannot be trusted to store sensitive data. This flow enables the use of cryptographically-signed JWT tokens and does not share user data with the application.
Hybrid – This approach combines the two aforementioned flows. At first, it returns an ID token to the application via redirect URI. Then, the application submits the ID Token and receives a temporary access token.

LDAP/AD
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an application protocol that provides access to a directory of credentials. It exchanges information using the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF). You can share an LDAP directory across multiple applications. 
When you use LDAP with Active Directory (AD), you can store user identities in the central AD server, and applications make authentication requests to the LDAP/AD server. 
Connection Flow
1.The application (known as the client) sends a request to access information stored in an LDAP database.
2.The application provides user credentials (username and password) to the LDAP server
3.The LDAP server matches user-submitted credentials with user identity data stored in the LDAP database or AD. User identities can be based on attributes like addresses, phone numbers, or group membership.
4.If the provided credentials match the stored user ID, LDAP permits the client to access the requested information.
5.If the credentials are incorrect, LDAP denies access.
LDAP/AD Use Cases
Because LDAP is an open, cross-platform protocol, you can use it with multiple directory service providers and applications. LDAP is most commonly used as a central location to store credentials like usernames and passwords.
Popular applications that support LDAP authentication include OpenVPN, Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. System administrators can use LDAP’s SSO feature to manage LDAP database access across multiple applications.
Social Login vs. Enterprise SSO
Many popular social media services, including Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, provide SSO services. These services allow end-users to log into third-party applications using their social media authentication credentials. While social single sign-on is convenient for users, it can also pose a security risk, by creating a single point of failure that attackers can exploit.
Many security experts say that social login is not appropriate for enterprise access control, because if an attacker compromises the user’s social credentials, they can use those credentials to access multiple organizational systems. 
Enterprise SSO is a single sign-on solution that gives end users secure one-click access to all enterprise applications, validating users against a trusted identity provider controlled by the organization. This allows the organization to implement more stringent measures to prevent identity theft. For added security, businesses can also implement multi factor authentication (MFA) or adaptive MFA.

16 Best Single Sign-on Tools in 2024

As an IT manager, one of the critical challenges you face is managing user identities efficiently and securely within your organization. This is where single sign-on (SSO) tools come into play, offering a vital solution that simplifies how identities are managed and accessed.
Your employees often need access to multiple applications and systems to perform their daily tasks. This means they must remember a multitude of usernames and passwords, leading to password fatigue and security risks. 
Single sign-on tools address this issue by allowing users to access multiple applications with just one set of login credentials. This enhances user convenience and boosts security by reducing the chances of password-related security breaches.
Moreover, with SSO tools, you can streamline the process of onboarding and offboarding employees. User accounts can be provisioned and deprovisioned across various applications from a central dashboard, reducing administrative overhead.
But before we dive into the list of single sign-on tools, let's explore more about single sign-on and features required in an effective single sign-on tool.
What Is Single Sign-On (SSO)?
Single sign-on (SSO) is an advanced authentication method that empowers users to access multiple applications and websites using a single set of credentials. By doing so, SSO elegantly streamlines the user authentication process, enhancing convenience and security.
Let's say your organization uses Microsoft 365 for email, Slack for team communication, and Salesforce for customer relationship management (CRM). Without SSO, your employees would have to remember separate credentials for each of these platforms.
Now, implement SSO. Your employee logs in once, and they gain access to their email, Slack, and Salesforce accounts without entering separate usernames and passwords. If they leave the company, your IT team simply disables their master key, instantly revoking access to all applications.
What Features Should You Look For in a Single Sign-on Solution?
SSO tools come equipped with a range of features designed to meet the unique needs of you and your team:

Centralized Identity Management: You can manage user identities, permissions, and access rights from a single, intuitive interface, providing them with complete control over user access.

Top 6 Single Sign-On Solutions for 2023 and SSO-MDM Integration

The digital transformation of workplaces has removed the fixed single set of perimeters of office premises. We can observe an increasing need for a strong security posture even within office premises, and with the ‘work-from-anywhere’ phenomenon, the concerns around security continue to heighten. Thus, the adoption of security solutions has witnessed a sharp rise worldwide. One such solution that is a must-have in today’s tech and business environment is Single Sign-On. Along with SSO, businesses are also leveraging marketing automation platforms for SaaS to streamline their marketing efforts and enhance efficiency.
What is a Single Sign On?
Single Sign-On or SSO is a mechanism that allows users to authenticate themselves once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without the need to provide their credentials again for each individual app or system. It eliminates the need for users to remember and manage multiple usernames and passwords for different applications or websites. Hence, choosing the best single sign-on solution becomes imperative for businesses. 
Different SSO protocols and standards, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect, provide frameworks for implementing SSO across various applications and platforms. Another critical element is the integration of Single Sign-On with other solutions, such as Mobile Device Management (MDM).
In this blog, let’s look into some of the best single sign-on solutions out there in 2023. We will also touch upon the importance of SSO-MDM integration.

Importance of SSO-MDM Integration
The integration between SSO and MDM solutions is crucial for businesses for several reasons:
Enhanced Security 
The integration of single sign-on and MDM allows for stronger security measures. MDM solutions enable businesses to enforce device-level security policies, such as data encryption, passcode requirements, and remote data wipe. These actions need to be performed with extreme caution. 
When the MDM platform is integrated with SSO, users can authenticate themselves using their preferred single sign-on before accessing the dashboard, ensuring that only authorized individuals can gain access. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and inappropriate actions on the MDM platform.
Simplified User Experience
SSO and MDM integration creates a seamless and convenient user experience. IT teams managing devices using an MDM solution can log in to their corporate dashboard using their work email credentials once and gain automatic access to all authorized applications and resources via single sign-on solution. This eliminates the need for users to remember and repeatedly enter multiple usernames and passwords, streamlining the authentication process and improving productivity.
Centralized and Remote User Management
Integration between SSO and MDM provides centralized user management capabilities. User provisioning and deprovisioning can be automated, ensuring that access to the MDM platform is granted or revoked based on employee role and association with the company. 
This simplifies the administration process, reduces manual efforts, and enhances security by promptly removing access for users that no longer work for the organization or are no longer required to access the MDM platform.
Cost and Time Savings 
SSO-MDM integration reduces administrative overhead and saves time and costs associated with managing user accounts, passwords, and device configurations separately. Centralized user management, automated provisioning, and consistent security policies streamline processes and minimize the need for manual intervention.

The many problems with implementing Single Sign-On
Most SaaS startups want to sell to enterprises, but many are unprepared for an enterprise’s most-requested requirement: single sign-on (SSO). SaaS products are often designed for usernames and passwords, not complex integrations with identity providers (IdPs) like Okta, Google, or Active Directory.
When faced with the challenge of building those integrations, many developers will roll up their sleeves, read authentication and authorization specs, and get to work. Unfortunately, there can be so much room for interpretation in these specifications that SSO implementation becomes difficult, slow, and risky. If you are a small startup, or even a mid-sized business with a busy engineering team, this work can be a major drain and slow down your ability to begin acquiring enterprise clients.
It can cost precious weeks (or months) to implement SSO for an enterprise deal and, to many developers’ surprise, what worked for one enterprise customer may not work for the next one. SSO is unexpectedly challenging to do correctly and consistently. Let’s break down why, then offer some alternative approaches.
What's so hard about building SSO?
Let me tell you about the first time I tried to implement SSO.
I started Nylas Mail in 2013 after writing the initial lines of code in my dorm room at MIT. It became a very successful open-source project, and we raised more than $10M in an attempt to dethrone Microsoft Outlook. It wasn’t long before we needed to commercialize, which is when we faced a whole new audience of buyers: IT leaders and procurement professionals. We were excited to be speaking to enterprise clients about adoption, but they needed enterprise features to roll out Nylas at scale. As a small startup, we had designed our app for everyday users and not for enterprise adoption, so we weren’t prepared to integrate with an IdP or satisfy other enterprise requirements. The work to add those features proved too much for us, and kept us from commercial market success.
The lesson here is that without SSO and other enterprise features, a product can only go so far.
The key thing to understand about SSO is that it’s an integration problem. Most developers build apps by using OSS packages, such as Devise, which handles authentication for Ruby on Rails. This works for customers with basic requirements, allowing people to use different models with high modularity. At some point developers end up needing to integrate their product with an IdP, usually beginning with whatever their biggest customer needs. Different enterprises use different IdP solutions: some may use off-the-shelf solutions like Okta or Azure Active Directory, while others have their own custom homegrown solutions.
Any vendor wishing to sell to these companies must integrate with all of these IdPs, which means managing both IdP authentication and native credential-based users (that is, a username and password native to the vendor’s platform). Since none of the IdPs functions identically and there are so many SSO providers, you’ll need to maintain multiple integrations in parallel.
If you want to read about another journey in adding SSO to an enterprise product, here’s how Stack Overflow did it.
SSO integration goes beyond building features and functionalities and ensuring they perform. It takes considerable work to seamlessly adapt an app’s login flow. Orchestration and feature enablement are dependent upon IdP functionality and require new business logic with implications for mobile and two-factor authentication (2FA). SSO usually has 2FA built in too, creating additional complexity that must be considered alongside other system-level integrations.
SAML is half the battle
There are multiple ways to implement SSO. One of the most popular is through an XML-based open standard called Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The SAML specification is flexible and has a number of options to cover a range of possible cases. No two vendors implement the spec the same way. In other words, it’s not implemented consistently and there are several “flavors” of SAML. As a result, it’s rife with opportunities for security issues.
To be clear, it’s not that the spec is designed poorly. Rather, when the protocols were designed, the designers wanted to cover a lot of possibilities. A lot can be done with SAML that’s rarely implemented. But any SSO integration still needs to be ready to support certain edge cases, which is where the vulnerabilities surface.
SAML payloads
When preparing for an SSO integration, an enterprise vendor will likely conduct a security review of SAML code to look for exploitable code or flows. For example, SAML uses certificates and signatures for payloads, which can be made particularly complicated by nested data structures. This is handy for management of multiple levels of IdP communication, particularly at large enterprises where there may be multiple layers of SAML authentication to pass through. Each layer has signatures that need verification, a process that can be like peeling an onion. A generalized SAML integration can be difficult to implement and check because it’s not always hierarchical and requests between systems can be non-linear.
If every layer isn’t thoroughly checked, malicious actors can misuse the payload. A common SAML exploit is to modify valid responses and inject a different invalid signature from an expired session. The reason this works is simple: one of the SAML SSO developers wrote code that checks for valid signatures, but not through the entire response. Every layer of the SAML payload needs to be investigated through and through. Most organizations don’t have multi-level ID systems, so this isn’t a particularly common exploit, but the protocol supports it because it was designed with this type of flexibility in mind.
Lack of standardization can easily lead to failures and vulnerabilities
When it comes to SSO, there are thousands of things to get right and a lot of small details to account for. You can implement something and get it working, but robustness will come from testing it against implementations. And while the specification is standardized, those implementations aren’t.
Consider writing a SAML integration for a new organizational platform. The platform may use canonical XML, but may not explicitly declare a namespace, which can cause an authentication failure. Even if both parties on each side of the flow conform to the spec, there’s no guarantee that it will work out of the box. It’s especially painful when one party makes even a small change to their implementation because it can lead to login failures that are especially difficult to troubleshoot. A user might call the IT department and say, “I can’t log in,” launching a wild goose chase in an effort to troubleshoot an issue with a small XML change on a system they don’t control.
SAML’s XML-based nature comes with XML-related challenges. Object ordering and arrangement of nested entities (that is, tags) can cause problems. Attribute mapping is non-standard across platforms. The identifiers for users on platforms are not standardized. Sometimes you get an ID, sometimes an email. Sometimes there’s no identifier and it’s something opaque like a serialized Active Directory string. It might be tempting to use an open-source library—nothing beats the low price of free—but not many open-source packages handle XML well.
App design can influence SAML functionality and security
SSO integration can also differ based on the structure of an application. For example, I can log into GitHub with my personal Gmail account and then jump into one of my company’s internal systems. GitHub is essentially acting as a second authentication factor for my internal app, allowing me to skip over the primary authentication mechanism for the app. You can have primary and secondary ways of authenticating—and different flows for email and password authentication–but whether those systems work as designed is influenced by the nature of the application itself.
When you’re building an app with SAML SSO, you don’t have to worry about changing usernames or passwords because that can be done outside of your application. However, the flows have to reflect that reality. Some IdP systems, such as Microsoft’s Active Directory, which provides an opaque, unique string, don’t provide an email address. If you don’t get an email address, then you have to figure out another way of identifying and authenticating a user. That method may not work with your application’s data structure or overall architecture.
Many enterprise-ready SaaS apps start SSO logins by asking for the organization’s subdomain. A behind-the-scenes lookup directs you to the login form for that company’s IdP login on that SaaS application. The problem is that a malicious actor might be able to find an exploit by typing a variety of company subdomains and know who’s using SSO and SAML. If that malicious actor is looking to use a newly-discovered security vulnerability, it’s possible that exploit will work on at least one of these IdP login screens.
Building SSO-capable user interfaces is difficult and every company is doing something different. The most common pattern is to have username and password fields with some IdP icons below and in small text, “Sign in with SAML/SSO.” Apple’s iCloud login doesn’t show a password field right away because they check whether the username’s domain is covered by an SSO flow. Slack uses custom CNAMEs in their URLs, like StackOverflow.slack.com and sends you to the right login flow. There’s no standard way of doing it, which is why everyone does it differently.
Onboarding enterprises and offboarding people
Another complication related to SAML-based SSO is onboarding new customers. Let’s say you’re a SaaS vendor and you’ve just signed your first big contract with a major enterprise. Now it’s time to get those enterprise users into your systems. Your integration engineer will get the SAML integration set up by working with the enterprise’s security architect.
Setting up a SAML integration involves exchanging a set of data parameters, like redirect URLs, and field mapping of SAML attributes. There’s no clear spec for how names should be (such as case sensitivity), so testing will need to be done to ensure both sides work. There’s also the need to upload a certificate, which also has no clear methodology in the spec.
Testing the SAML integration is a huge friction point for companies and it’s almost always done manually, which means the tools for the setup are managed manually as well. At its most basic, companies have used a simple spreadsheet or form for the data parameter exchange. The process is so prone to breakage, it’s often handled with white-glove personalized service. Building a multi-use admin panel for SAML is expensive and difficult, so companies usually proceed with manual work until the project becomes cost-prohibitive.
Coordinating, configuring, implementing, and testing SSO can take weeks if not months of back-and-forth communication. It’s an arduous process, often involving lots of discussion and work around authentication (“here’s the validated identity of a user”) and authorization (“here are the services and features to which the validated user has access”). Enterprise ID systems like SAML only do authentication to prove someone is who they say they are, leaving authorization up to apps and services. SAML should be brokering actual sessions like a one-bit authorization, proving a person is who they say they are, almost like scanning an RFID badge at a security door. What happens after they pass through the door is another thing altogether.
Session management challenges
When you authenticate with SAML, you’re authenticating a user, but after that validation, you can’t check that it’s still a current active session. You know you had a current session at a point in time when you authenticated, but how long does your session last? If it’s too short—say, 24 hours—it can be a pain, requiring a login every day for every user. There are ways to get around this if you have access to other identity systems, but the point is: session management is challenging.
For B2C SaaS products, logging out users has a negative effect on retention and engagement. Most products have a two-week cookie to keep the session fresh, but enterprise IT admins don’t always want that. SaaS vendors, especially those just selling to their first enterprise customer, may have to rethink session management for their apps. Then there are considerations for how sessions are managed on mobile devices.
Offboarding users
When an enterprise signs a contract with your product, they bring a whole slew of new users. But not all of those users will stay for the life of the contract. A variety of processes need to be designed for enterprise employee departures. For example:
What happens to a user’s data when an employee leaves?
Does the user’s data or account get transitioned to an administrative account?
Should all sessions be revoked? If so, how soon and how will you find out they left?
How will shared items be handled?
What needs to be deactivated and what needs to be preserved?
These are several important questions to consider when selling to enterprise customers. They’re not easy questions to answer, especially if user deactivation is already implemented in an inflexible way.
When an employee departs a client organization, perhaps on bad terms, there’s a chance they have access to sensitive information, important deliverables in progress, or shared documents with impactful financial implications. Without a solid plan for offboarding those users, SaaS vendors can find themselves on the critical path for their enterprise clients’ HR, IT, and information security offboarding processes. If the employee chooses to sabotage or tamper with data to which they should no longer have access, that’s bad news for the vendor.
Crossing the enterprise chasm
When selling to an enterprise, your product needs to offer enterprise features. Implementing SSO—the most requested enterprise feature—may require changes from application and data architecture to how a dev team operates and interacts with large clients. There’s almost nothing within a SaaS app that doesn’t require reconsideration (or at least a double check) for supporting that first enterprise client.
SSO isn’t just about building an enterprise-level feature, but about maintaining a set of flows that enable different clients with different IdPs to use an app. Building SSO with SAML requires a lot of decisions and business logic, which doesn’t happen organically. Additionally, it’s best practice to ensure there’s more than one person on staff who understands the SAML implementation. Otherwise, if the dev leaves and no one knows the protocols, it can get messy fast. And enterprises don’t want to mess around with SAML.
By far, SSO is the most important enterprise feature to implement, so if there’s only enough budget for one feature, it should be SSO. It’s the gateway to selling to a ton of companies. Going deeper, vendors should consider whether any of the following would be of additional benefit to their SAML SSO implementation:
Directory integration
Automatic user lifecycle management
Deprovisioning users
Auto-login for audit compliance and e-retention
SOC 2 compliance
GDPR
HIPAA
Granular role-based access control (RBAC)
Enterprise key management (bring your own key and encryption)
Before jumping head first into building SSO, take a look at WorkOS. SSO is just one of the features we offer with just a few lines of code in your app. We maintain tight integration with the most popular IdPs, have an easy-to-use administration panel that enterprises love, offer live synchronization with enterprise user directories, and make multi-factor authentication a breeze.

The advantages of SSO authentication for your SaaS

For several years, the world of work has experienced the advent of the SaaS (Software as a Service) model, with the pandemic and teleworking further accelerating the adoption of new online applications.
The number of SaaS used has never been greater, often reaching several hundred within large groups.

As a BetterCloud report from 2021 illustrates, companies with more than 10,000 employees use an average of 447 different SaaS solutions.
Most of a company's departments (marketing, finance, HR, accounting, etc.) are now users of SaaS solutions.

The moderate cost of these solutions and their ease of implementation have favored the decentralization of decision-making circuits for the acquisition of these tools outside the IT department, and enabled the business teams to be autonomous in their deployments.

The solutions offered are varied, ranging from project management with solutions like Trello, customer relationship management with solutions like HubSpot or Salesforce, to invoicing or design with solutions like Stripe or even Figma.
An essential point remains in the phase of setting up and deploying SaaS solutions in large companies: the compliance of SaaS in terms of security requirements, particularly on the authentication part with the SSO connection.
Used for years within large groups, Single Sign On (SSO) authentication allows an employee to simply access multiple applications with a single identifier from anywhere and with any device, while remaining at the highest level of security. 
How does SSO authentication work? 
Single Sign On authentication is an authentication process that allows users to securely access multiple applications using a single set of username and password.
Once the SSO authentication is in place, employees of a company will be able to access all the applications and all the websites available within their company by registering only once. 
In other words, SSO authentication allows access to multiple systems by connecting to a single system, rather than multiplying usernames and passwords across all applications.
This authentication process is made possible thanks to the relationship of trust established between two entities: the identity provider (IdP) which is a digital identity manager (solutions such as Okta or Ping Identity), and the application to which a user wishes to access, the service provider (SP).
Communication between these two entities takes place via an IT standard allowing the exchange of security-related information: SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) assertions.

If the user is not authenticated, here are the different steps of the SSO connection:

1. The user accesses the service provider (SP) from the internet or the application
2. The service provider sends a request to the identity provider
3. The user is asked to enter the identifiers of the identity provider (username + password)
4. The identity provider validates the identifiers (or not) and in turn sends a SAML assertion to the service provider attesting to the validity of the authentication
5. The service provider authorizes the connection of the user
6. The user can enjoy the service he wanted to access

What are the benefits of SSO login? 
An increased productivity  
Within companies, employees access a large number of cloud applications on a daily basis to do their jobs.
Thanks to Single Sign On authentication, the time spent by employees logging in and managing their password is considerably reduced, which greatly facilitates their daily activities.
Users only need to remember one password rather than dozens.
Some identity providers also have an autofill feature for the password field, which completely eliminates the need to remember your password.
In addition, SSO authentication providers provide access to a platform in which the employee can find all the applications he can access to do his job.
The time spent remembering passwords and resetting them is therefore reduced to zero.
A greater security
SSO drastically reduces the risk of account hacking.
Indeed, with this authentication method, users no longer have different passwords across the applications they use, but a single password allowing them to access all applications.
Since users only have one password to remember, it is much easier to create a much more complex and robust password or phrase password.
SSO also reduces the repetition of passwords across applications, and eliminates the need to write down passwords on a piece of paper to remember them.
In addition, Single Sign On reduces account sharing. Indeed, a collaborator could share his password on an application with a colleague in order to help him, but if this password gives access to all the applications, then it is likely that the collaborator does not share his password. outmoded.
In order to have maximum security during authentication, it may be wise to combine SSO with another authentication factor, and thus to set up multi-factor authentication.
Reduced IT maintenance costs
The more different passwords a user has, the greater the risk of forgetting, and the higher the costs for the support team.

According to a recent study by Gartner, the cost of managing passwords is $70 to $200 per user.

If the user has a unique password, the chances of them calling on your customer support are therefore lower, and the time spent by your support teams solving problems related to passwords is reduced. 
A better user experience
Regardless of your field of activity, whether you are a marketplace type website or a SaaS, too much complexity in authentication will have consequences on the shopping cart or the level of use of your solution.
The advantage of SSO is to quickly integrate your application into your users' daily lives, rather than confusing them with the creation of a new account in an external application.
Being able to log in to your application with the credentials they use on a daily basis reduces friction and makes the experience smoother for your users.
An application where the authentication process is laborious will frustrate users, and will not have as high a usage rate as an application offering a simpler experience.
Thanks to SSO, you put all the chances on your side to promote the adoption and use of your application.
Regulatory compliance
Several regulations concerning data protection, in particular the Sarbanes-Oxley regulation, the HIPAA regulation or the GDPR, impose rules on companies in order to protect data against cyber criminals.
In addition, the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) regulations require companies to assign a unique identifier to all employees to allow them to access the various company resources.
In the event of a breach, the consequences can be serious for companies (fines, loss of customer confidence, etc.).
Implementing SSO early in its product lifecycle means complying with the regulations in force from the start and ensuring the secure sharing of company resources.
Being connected to the SSO system allows SaaS solutions to be visible as a full partner to the IT department, which can thus have a more complete visibility of the solutions used by the company.
Thus the SaaS connected in SSO can be part of a long-term relationship with its client.
A quick implementation with Cryptr
At Cryptr we want to provide the most enjoyable experience possible for developers, so that you can offer the authentication that best suits the needs of your customers.

Thanks to our complete panel of SDKs (React, Angular, VueJS, etc.) and our API implementations (NodeJS, PHP, Laravel, Symfony, Go, Django, Flask, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.), it only takes a few hours to enable the SSO connection on your SaaS.

Our successful developer team is there to support you in setting up the solution and allow you to offer your customers SSO authentication as quickly as possible, and regardless of the identity provider used by your customers (Azure AD, Google, Okta, Ping Identity, SiteMinder, IBM Security Verify, etc.).

If you are thinking of integrating SSO authentication on your SaaS, it is possible to access a test version of Cryptr, in order to allow you to test the SSO connection in a sandbox environment, and with the identity provider of your choice.
Once Cryptr is implemented, onboarding new customers in SSO becomes child's play.

All you have to do is send a URL link to your client's IT Admin, who is then autonomous in configuring his SSO system on your SaaS, thanks to our self-service onboarding: 

Once the person in charge of IT at your client clicks on the URL, they access an interactive step-by-step onboarding, guiding them from A to Z in setting up the SSO connection on your SaaS.
Once the identity provider has been selected, a step-by-step onboarding is guiding your customer thanks to screenshots indicating where to retrieve the various information (ACS URL, SLO, X509 certificate etc.)
The average time to complete this step-by-step onboarding is 5 minutes, and this allows your technical teams to focus on other topics rather than having meetings with your customers to exchange this different information.
In summary, the SSO connection allows you to have reinforced security, a more pleasant experience for your users, and less time spent by your support teams managing password-related issues.
SSO login is even more attractive when combined with a directory synchronization strategy with your customers.
Cryptr's Directory Sync allows you to have a permanently up-to-date user directory with the user database present at your client: the attributes of your users are permanently up-to-date, and there is no longer any need to manually provision users.

How to Choose the Best Single Sign-on (SSO) Solution for your Enterprise

Safeguard Your Organization
When it comes to selecting a single sign-on solution for your organization, not all solutions are created equal. Choosing the best workforce SSO solution depends on your IT environment and user base.
 
Some SSO solutions control authentication for users accessing resources from desktops in a single security domain. Others provide universal SSO across complex hybrid environments that include legacy on-premises, cloud-based and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. SSO solutions can act as an authentication authority. They can be used for many identity types and use cases, from cloud to on-premises.
 
IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021 found that data breach costs rose from $3.86 million to $4.24 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year. Compromised credentials were the most common initial attack vector and responsible for 20% of breaches, at an average breach cost of $4.37 million.
 
According to Accenture’s 2021 Cyber Threat Intelligence Report, data migration to the cloud and the advance of internet-connected devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) objects, switches and routers control data flowing in and out of the organization, increase the risk of cyberattacks. The report also highlights that in multiple ransomware attacks in 2020, data was destroyed rather than encrypted.
 
We'll explain the fundamentals of single sign-on (SSO) and provide criteria to help you choose the best SSO solution for your business.
What is Single Sign-on
Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication solution that allows users to login to their applications and services with a single set of credentials. Without SSO, employees have to create sign-on credentials for every app, sign in multiple times, and remember numerous passwords. SSO streamlines the process by giving employees secure, one-click access from any device. By reducing the number of usernames and passwords users need to remember, the overall user experience is improved. This also increases data security.


How does Single Sign-on Work?
With users signing on from a variety of devices to access on-premises, cloud and/or SaaS applications, enterprises need to provide secure single sign-on to trusted service providers, even when those apps and services are outside their firewalls or owned by third parties.
 
The foundation of single sign-on is the trust relationship between user, identity provider (IdP) and service provider (SP). The user has an account with an Identity Provider (IdP). Examples of IdPs include employers and telecommunications providers. These IdPs maintain a directory of users and an authentication mechanism. The SP can be a website, application or service.



 
The first time the user signs on, the username and password are sent to the IdP for authentication. The authentication server checks the user's credentials with the directory data. Once verified, an SSO session is initiated on the user's browser. When the user requests access to websites, apps and other SPs, the user’s identity is verified behind the scenes. Using identity standards, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC), encrypted tokens are transmitted securely between the IdP and SP to indicate the user has already been authenticated and has permission to access their services.
 
Many enterprises have trust relationships with numerous service providers that employees need to access. They may also have multiple identity providers that business units or partners use to sign on. For large enterprises, a flexible federation hub to provide SSO between IdPs and SPs, no matter how they’re configured or what standards they use, can be appropriate.




Examples of Single Sign-on
SSO solutions go beyond workforce applications. SSO can also be used for customers and partners.
 
Workforce
An employee can access their corporate email account by logging in with their email address and password. They can then access other applications without needing to provide any additional credentials. Access to internal and external applications needed for work is streamlined, such as instant messaging, sales data, and the intranet. This simplifies the process and increases productivity while reducing frustration. 
 
Partner
A retailer can grant secure access to data for its partners. They must log into an application dock once. After that, they can access all the apps and services enabled by the retailer without needing to log in again.
 
Customer
A credit card customer can log into their account to check a variety of things. They can view their balance, review prior statements, pay their bill and check their credit score. Additionally, they can use their accumulated points for travel, even if these services are on separate applications By not forcing customers to log into each application separately, customer satisfaction is increased.
Choosing the Best Single Sign-On Solution for your Enterprise
An organization’s needs and budget can be used to determine the best single sign-on vendor and solution. A holistic approach balances user expectations, IT objectives and business objectives. A sample of evaluation criteria by group includes:
 
Employee Requirements

What is the overall user experience? Is the login experience consistent? 


Can users access the portal via an application on their phone or tablet? 


Does the solution offer a strong/multi-factor authentication (MFA) solution that is easy to use?


Does the single sign-on vendor offer self-service registration and account management mechanisms?

 

IT Requirements

Can the SSO solution support hybrid deployments (on-premises and cloud-based)?


Is it a cloud services (IDaaS offering) or on-premises SSO offering? 


Does the solution support all of the relevant standards including SAML, OAuth and OpenID® Connect?


Does the vendor support multiple second-factor and MFA solutions?

 

Business Requirements

How do the vendor and solution rank with analysts such as Gartner, Forrester and KuppingerCole?


Does the vendor's technology platform and pricing make it easy to upgrade from workforce SSO? Will this upgrade support additional enterprise IAM use cases? Would these use cases be applicable for employees, partners, and customers?


Is the vendor considered a thought leader that is driving the identity market toward open standards?


What is the vendor’s customer satisfaction rating (independently verified)?

Popular SSO Solution for B2B SaaS

For many SaaS startups, the ultimate goal is to sell their product to large enterprises. However, these companies often have very specific requirements that can prove to be challenging. One such requirement is single sign-on (SSO), which can be a complex and time-consuming task for SaaS startups that are not well-prepared.
SaaS products are typically designed to work with usernames and passwords, but integrating with identity providers (IdPs) like Okta, Google, or Active Directory requires a much deeper level of understanding. Unfortunately, the specifications for authentication and authorization can be open to interpretation, making the implementation of SSO difficult, slow, and risky.
For small or mid-sized businesses with limited engineering resources, the process of building SSO integrations can be a major drain on time and productivity. It can take weeks, if not months, to implement SSO for an enterprise client, and even then, there is no guarantee that the solution will work for all customers.
Implementing SSO correctly and consistently is unexpectedly challenging, and can become a major roadblock to acquiring enterprise clients. But fear not, there are alternative approaches that can be just as effective. By leveraging the latest technology and tools, SaaS startups can provide a seamless and secure experience for their enterprise clients, without sacrificing time or resources.

How to Trace a DDoS Attack

A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack prevents a website from functioning properly by flooding the targeted network or server with an overwhelming number of requests. The intention of the attacker behind these attacks is to prevent legitimate users from accessing the targeted website and servers.
What do you do if you find yourself under a DDoS attack?
The first step is to find the source of the DDoS attack. Not only is this important to understand who is behind it, but also to stop the attack. The fact that this assault targets numerous systems, including application servers, nameservers, and routers, raise the stakes further.
In this article, we’ll break down how to trace a DDoS attack and share some common mistakes to avoid while doing it.
1. Take Remedial Action Within the First 5 Minutes
The first five minutes when you find yourself under a DDoS attack is highly critical.
You have to take remedial steps to minimize the damage in real-time and get your website back online. First of all, use an IPS tool to filter out bad traffic at the edge and push the attack back upstream to enable your website to operate normally. This device can also trace the direct attackers (the infected bots) that launched the malicious packets at your system. 
However, you have to go deeper since these decoys are just the first layer of the attack.
Many botnet operators use IP addresses sourced from the darknet (i.e the unused IP addresses space held by ISPs) to make DDoS attacks more untraceable. So when you try to trace the attack back, you’ll only find the hijacked addresses and not the attacker behind them.
While you do this, always remember your priority isn’t to identify the cybercriminals—but to end the attack. Focus on filtering out the malicious traffic and work with other ISPs to identify whether the attack is spoofed or originates from another provider or a third party. Follow this up by blocking the botnets generating the traffic.
Alternatively, you can redirect traffic to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) and use a web application protection service to minimize the intensity of the attack. In case of large-scale suspicious DDoS traffic, you can use a WAF and an AI deep learning WAF.
2. Trace the Bots and Controllers Behind the DDoS Attack Within the First Hour
At this stage, the attacking packets are blocked and the targeted server or website is recovering. Next, you want to trace the command and control infrastructure behind the DDoS-attacking botnet.
A major challenge here is tracing back a botnet. This can take a lot of time and energy, which is something you don’t have in this critical time. Therefore, your best approach here is to IP traceback specific packets (or sequences of packets) coming in.
Here’s how to go about it:
Trace the bot’s IP and operating system
Track its geolocation, which could be anywhere in the world
Identify the backbone network providers of the bot
Reach out to them and make them stop
The above steps are feasible when you are tracking one or two bots. But tracking an entire botnet that can have over 30,000-35,000 infected bots isn’t.
So what do you do next? The DDoS attacker often uses one or more controllers or proxies to hide behind the botnet. That’s where you strike.
Attackers use these machines to send obfuscated or encrypted messages to these controllers. Go after them to trace the main source of the attack and contact the owners and ISPs to block these machines. Admittedly, this is more challenging than IP traceback, but it’s also far more efficient.
3. Use Forensics to Help You Investigate the DDoS Attack
Forensics use trace evidence to reconstruct the DDoS attack from the beginning to the end. But before that, they’ll actually need the evidence, which you’ll collect and provide by going as deep as possible into the affected network or server.
While the cybercriminals behind other DDoS attacks are masters at hiding and creating smokescreens to protect their true identity, they often make mistakes—something you can leverage to find valuable intelligence.
You want to understand the following when investigating the attack:
What is the motivation behind launching the attack? This will help you build a criminal profile and understand brother attacker is after money, power, or control.
Was the attacker only trying to open a backdoor or steal your data?
Carrying out a DDoS attack involves a lot of resources. Where do you think the attacker is getting them from?
Did the attacker use a DDoS Booter or a Botnet as a Service? Perhaps someone internally made a DNS request to one of these services? Look into it.
Can you identify whether the attacker was using any similar stress testing tools? (Hping, LOIC)
Is it possible to follow a payment trail for the DDoS attack?
Try to look at the attack from different angles to determine the real objective of the attack.
Common Problems When Tracing a DDoS Attack
In this section, we’ll take a look at the common mistakes made by victims of DDoS services. 
Not Familiarizing Themselves With the Signs of a DDoS Attack
Not many IT professionals realize they can detect a DDoS attack at the very beginning by familiarizing themselves with the many indirect signs. Here is a list of some of the more common DDoS Attack attack signs:
A rapid increase in incoming traffic on one or more ports
Server software and OS failing frequently and hanging—sometimes, even shutting down incorrectly
A sharp increase in load on your server’s hardware capacity, which differs significantly from the average daily indicators
Seeing multiple duplicated actions of the same type on the same resource
Detecting several requests of the same type from different sources to the same port or service
The greater your knowledge of the signs of DDoS attacks, the faster you can identify and take the necessary measures to limit its adverse effects. You don’t need deep, in-depth knowledge of DDoS attacks, but it’s good to have a fair idea of the common indications (both direct and indirect). 
Not Changing the Server IP or Calling Your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
When you’re under a full-scale DDoS attack, make sure you immediately change the server IP and DNS name to minimize the damage and stop the attack in its tracks. In case you find the attacker still being vigilant, start directing traffic to your new IP address. If even that fails, don’t hesitate to call your ISP and ask that to block or re-route the malicious traffic.
Failing to Monitor Attack Progression
Throughout the attack, you should continually monitor its progression to see how it develops over time. This can also help you collect the intelligence necessary to help forensics recreate the attack later.
Here are a few key questions you should use to try and assess the attack:
What kind of DDoS attack is it (application-layer attack, network-level flood)?
Can you outline the key characteristics of the attack?
How large is the scope of the attack (both in terms of packets-per-second and bits-per-second)?
Is the attack coming from a single IP source or multiple sources? Is it possible for you to identify them?
How would you describe the attack pattern (think: whether it’s a burst attack or a single sustained flood)? Does the attack involve a single protocol or multiple attack vectors?
Is the attacker focusing on the same target or are they changing their targets over time?
Finding out the answers to these questions will give you a better idea of the extent and intensity of the attack, plus figure out the right course of action to get your website or server back to normal faster.
Neglecting the DDoS Attack’s Architecture
You cannot trace a DDoS attack and identify who is behind it without studying the attack’s architecture.
As you now know, the basic anatomy of any DDoS attack is Attacker > Botnet > Victim. A botnet is a network of instruction-following bots. Without it, the attacker is just a DoS, which is a much weaker and easier-to-stop form of cyber assault, plus it’s also easier to trace.
Adding a botnet into the picture boosts the attack’s efficiency and power while also concealing the source. It’s possible that you may not be able to identify the source IP of these bots, but it’s still worth trying.
Final Thoughts
Tracing a DDoS attack that comes from thousands of infected machines turned into “zombie“ bots isn’t an easy feat. But using a few popular tools, such as reverse engineering, mitigation, and forensics, can give you an upper hand, helping minimize the damage from these attacks and getting your system and server functioning like normal.
We hope this article helps you strategize and create an effective action plan to trace a DDoS attack. Nevertheless, the best course of action is to practice precaution and implement measures and systems to prevent a DDoS attack from occurring in the first place.

How to Trace a DDOS Attack

At most any time of the day, there's a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack underway somewhere on the Internet.
Yes, it's still true, despite reports that some ISPs have experienced fewer DDOS attacks overall during the last six months. It's a matter of quality, not quantity: "When DDOSes do occur, they are done with much greater purpose than they used to be," says Rodney Joffe, senior vice president and senior technologist for Neustar, a directory services and clearinghouse provider for Internet industry. "They are usually to obscure what's [really] happening in the background."
Phishing and pharming are more lucrative for cybercriminals, he says. "So they are using DDOS strategically" instead of as the main attack mode, he says.
ISPs consider DDOS attacks -- where an attacker floods network connections, Websites, or systems with packets -- one of their biggest threats. Most of these attacks are being waged by botnets -- some as large as tens of thousands of bot machines, according to a recent survey of ISPs by Arbor Networks. Arbor found an average of 1,200 DDOS attacks each day across 38 ISP networks. On 220 of the last 365 days, there has been at least one DDOS attack of one million packets per second, says Danny McPherson, chief research officer for Arbor Networks. (See Report: Attacks on ISP Nets Intensifying.)
Just like botnets, DDOS attacks have become stealthier and tougher to trace than ever, with layers of bot armies disguising the original source. "Tracing a DDOS is a particularly vexing problem, with the whole notion of obfuscation and onion routing [techniques]," says Steve Bannerman, vice president of marketing and product management for Narus. (See ISPs Try on Anti-Botnet Services Model.)
And finding the origin of the attack is becoming more important than ever. Some DDOSes won't die if you don't really get to the source. "It's critical to ID the source in some cases -- not just because [you] want to know who's behind it, but [you] can't actually stop the attack" until you do, Joffe says.
But finding the source isn't as simple as identifying the IP addresses of the actual bots that sent the packets. "In a large-scale DDOS, you don't initially ID the source, because it's often innocent," he says. "It tells you these 25,000 machines worldwide are the source of this attack, but it's a giant problem to track the owners of all those machines and get them to stop. Almost without exception, they are innocent owners who have no idea -- and would not know how to turn [the attack] off."
There are three main stages of mitigating a DDOS attack. The key is for ISPs to stop the damage, while at the same time carefully peeling back the layers of the attack to be sure they actually get to the root of it.
Stage 1: The First Five Minutes
Like any attack, it's the first few minutes that are the most crucial to minimizing the damage -- and getting the victim organization back online if the attack has overwhelmed its connection. "This requires a well-oiled group to react -- to spot it and push mitigation in place in real-time," Joffe says.
Devices like Arbor Networks's IPS can filter out the bad traffic at the edge. "This allows you to push the attack back upstream through the major backbone providers, where you can once again begin to operate" normally, he says.
It's in this phase that the ISP can trace the direct attackers, usually the clueless, infected bots that launched the packets at the victim. But these decoys are just the first layer of the attack. "How do you contact those 35,000 machine owners somewhere in the world? That would take a few weeks," he says. "But the problem is in the first five minutes."
That's if you can trace the bots at all: Many sophisticated botnet operators hijack so-called "darknet" IP addresses -- the unused IP address space held by ISPs -- to make them more untraceable. "When you try to trace it back, you find the addresses were hijacked, so you don't know who the attacker is," Narus's Bannerman says. So Narus's system monitors traffic for so-called "hijacked prefixes," he says.
Still, the priority of the enterprise under siege isn't identifying the bad guy -- it's ending the attack. "They are less concerned about the source of the attack and taking any other [investigative] actions -- which lead into forensics and legal, which may be futile," says Cecil Adams, senior product manager for Verizon Business, which offers a DDOS service. "They look to us to stop the attack... We make sure all the links are not congested with it."
That means filtering out the malicious traffic, and also working with other ISPs. Verizon can identify if an attack is spoofed, or if it originated from another provider or a third party, Adams says. "Then we can close out the botnets generating the traffic," he says.
Stage 2: The First Hour
Once the attacking packets have been blocked and the victim is recovering, it's time to trace the command and control infrastructure behind the DDOS-attacking botnet. "This is not as easy as it used to be," Neustar's Joffe says. Botnets are increasingly using encrypted links and peer-to-peer connections rather than the more conspicuous Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels that are often used for nefarious purposes.
"This [stage] requires a lot more resources, cooperation, and knowledge," he says.
It's in this stage that ISPs and researchers look at things from the point of view of the target of the DDOS. Who might be a logical attacker? A competitor? A crime ring that's been waging these attacks regularly?
Neustar lurks in underground chat sites to check for any hints or intelligence on the attacks or who might be behind them. And it tries to track how the bots are getting their orders, and over what communications channel.
"If we can disrupt that particular channel, it may have the ability to stop the attack more easily than trying to shut down 35,000 bot machines," he says. And that means going after the second layer of the command and control infrastructure. "They tend not to use their own machines in any part other than at the initial site to communicate," he says. "Ten or 15 machines actually operate as the controllers... We can contact those owners and ISPs can block those machines. That's more manageable."
Stage 3: The Investigation
Putting a face to the bad guys behind the attack is the stage where most ISPs prefer to defer to law enforcement and security researchers. They cooperate with law enforcement, but must be mindful of NDAs and privacy concerns with their customers.
"A lot of this doesn't get reported," Arbor's McPherson says. "Most of the time, network operators don't want to be party to that [law enforcement investigation]. ISPs typically aren't the actual target, and they [have to protect] customer data. And the victims don't want to report an attack because it could damage their reputation."
Not only that, but there's not one central place to report a DDOS attack, he says.
And even in the aftermath of a DDOS, it can take hours or days to determine the real objective of the attack, which is typically a diversion for a backdoor and a more dangerous targeted attack. "More often than not, you discover that what looked like the target really wasn't the end target," Joffe says.

About authentication with SAML single sign-on


About authentication with SAML SSO
SAML single sign-on (SSO) gives organization owners and enterprise owners using GitHub Enterprise Cloud a way to control and secure access to organization resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. Organization owners can invite your personal account on GitHub to join their organization that uses SAML SSO, which allows you to contribute to the organization and retain your existing identity and contributions on GitHub.
If you're a member of an enterprise with managed users, you will instead use a new account that is provisioned for you and controlled by your enterprise. For more information, see "Types of GitHub accounts."
When you attempt to access most resources within an organization that uses SAML SSO, GitHub will redirect you to the organization's SAML IdP to authenticate. After you successfully authenticate with your account on the IdP, the IdP redirects you back to GitHub, where you can access the organization's resources.
IdP authentication is not required for accessing public repositories in certain ways:
Viewing the repository's overview page and file contents on GitHub
Forking the repository
Performing read operations via Git, such as cloning the repository
Authentication is required for other access to public repositories, such as viewing issues, pull requests, projects, and releases.
Note: SAML authentication is not required for outside collaborators. For more information about outside collaborators, see "Roles in an organization."
If you have recently authenticated with your organization's SAML IdP in your browser, you are automatically authorized when you access a GitHub organization that uses SAML SSO. If you haven't recently authenticated with your organization's SAML IdP in your browser, you must authenticate at the SAML IdP before you can access the organization.
You must periodically authenticate with your SAML IdP to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on GitHub.com. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue. You can view and manage your active SAML sessions in your security settings. For more information, see "Viewing and managing your active SAML sessions."
Linked SAML identities
When you authenticate with your IdP account and return to GitHub, GitHub will record a link in the organization or enterprise between your GitHub personal account and the SAML identity you signed into. This linked identity is used to validate your membership in that organization, and depending on your organization or enterprise setup, is also used to determine which organizations and teams you're a member of as well. Each GitHub account can be linked to exactly one SAML identity per organization. Likewise, each SAML identity can be linked to exactly one GitHub account in an organization.
If you sign in with a SAML identity that is already linked to another GitHub account, you will receive an error message indicating that you cannot sign in with that SAML identity. This situation can occur if you are attempting to use a new GitHub account to work inside of your organization. If you didn't intend to use that SAML identity with that GitHub account, then you'll need to sign out of that SAML identity and then repeat the SAML login. If you do want to use that SAML identity with your GitHub account, you'll need to ask your admin to unlink your SAML identity from your old account, so that you can link it to your new account. Depending on the setup of your organization or enterprise, your admin may also need to reassign your identity within your SAML provider. For more information, see "Viewing and managing a member's SAML access to your organization."
If the SAML identity you sign in with does not match the SAML identity that is currently linked to your GitHub account, you'll receive a warning that you are about to relink your account. Because your SAML identity is used to govern access and team membership, continuing with the new SAML identity can cause you to lose access to teams and organizations inside of GitHub. Only continue if you know that you're supposed to use that new SAML identity for authentication in the future.
Authorizing personal access tokens and SSH keys with SAML SSO
To use the API or Git on the command line to access protected content in an organization that uses SAML SSO, you will need to use an authorized personal access token over HTTPS or an authorized SSH key.
If you don't have a personal access token or an SSH key, you can create a personal access token for the command line or generate a new SSH key. For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens" or "Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent."
To use a new or existing personal access token or SSH key with an organization that uses or enforces SAML SSO, you will need to authorize the token or authorize the SSH key for use with a SAML SSO organization. For more information, see "Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on" or "Authorizing an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on."
About OAuth apps, GitHub Apps, and SAML SSO
You must have an active SAML session each time you authorize an OAuth app or GitHub App to access an organization that uses or enforces SAML SSO. You can create an active SAML session by navigating to https://github.com/orgs/ORGANIZATION-NAME/sso in your browser.
After an enterprise or organization owner enables or enforces SAML SSO for an organization, and after you authenticate via SAML for the first time, you must reauthorize any OAuth apps or GitHub Apps that you previously authorized to access the organization.
To see the OAuth apps you've authorized, visit your OAuth apps page. To see the GitHub Apps you've authorized, visit your GitHub Apps page.

Cyber-Secure SDN: A CNN-Based Approach for Efficient Detection and Mitigation of DDoS Attacks

Abstract
Software Defined Networking (SDN) has become popular due to its flexibility and agility in network management, enabling rapid adaptation to changing business requirements, enhancing network performance, and reducing operational costs. However, the ubiquity of internet-based services has given rise to an alarming increase in cyber-attacks, posing serious threats to the security and stability of modern networks. Among these attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as one of the most devastating, capable of disrupting critical services. Recent studies have shown that Deep Learning (DL) techniques with Software-defined networking have the potential to mitigate these threats effectively. However, existing solutions suffer from issues such as reliance on pre-defined rules and signatures, computational efficiency, low detection rates, and inefficient notification mechanisms, making them ineffective in detecting DDoS attacks. This paper proposes an efficient approach (BRS + CNN) using Balanced Random Sampling (BRS) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect DDoS attacks in SDN environments. We have applied various mitigation techniques to mitigate these threats, such as filtering, rate limiting, and iptables rule for blocking spoofed IPs. In addition, we introduce a monitoring system that utilizes rate-limiting to oversee blocked IP addresses, ensuring that legitimate traffic is processed efficiently. The proposed model achieves high performance in binary and multi-classification, with an accuracy of over 99.99% for binary classification and 98.64% for multi-classification. Our proposed DDoS detection system not only detects the attack but also sends detailed contextual information to a designated email address. We compare our model with existing literature and demonstrate its superiority using Area Under The Curve (AUC) analysis. Moreover, we evaluated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed DDoS mitigation system by conducting a series of experiments across three distinct scenarios: Attack-Free, Attack-No Mitigation, and Attack-Mitigation. These results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed mitigation system in effectively combating DDoS attacks while also safeguarding the seamless continuity of regular network operations.

FLAD: Adaptive Federated Learning for DDoS attack detection


Abstract
Federated Learning (FL) has been recently receiving increasing consideration from the cybersecurity community as a way to collaboratively train deep learning models with distributed profiles of cyber threats, with no disclosure of training data. Nevertheless, the adoption of FL in cybersecurity is still in its infancy, and a range of practical aspects have not been properly addressed yet. Indeed, the Federated Averaging algorithm at the core of the FL concept requires the availability of test data to control the FL process. Although this might be feasible in some domains, test network traffic of newly discovered attacks cannot be always shared without disclosing sensitive information. In this paper, we address the convergence of the FL process in dynamic cybersecurity scenarios, where the trained model must be frequently updated with new recent attack profiles to empower all members of the federation with the latest detection features. To this aim, we propose FLAD (adaptive Federated Learning Approach to DDoS attack detection), an FL solution for cybersecurity applications based on an adaptive mechanism that orchestrates the FL process by dynamically assigning more computation to those members whose attacks profiles are harder to learn, without the need of sharing any test data to monitor the performance of the trained model. Using a recent dataset of DDoS attacks, we demonstrate that FLAD outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms in terms of convergence time and accuracy across a range of unbalanced datasets of heterogeneous DDoS attacks. We also show the robustness of our approach in a realistic scenario, where we retrain the deep learning model multiple times to introduce the profiles of new attacks on a pre-trained model.

Survey and classification of Dos and DDos attack detection and validation approaches for IoT environments

Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged over the past ten years as the newest technology trend that is luring researchers and developers from every sector of industry and academia. However, IoT is experiencing a number of security issues that are impeding its rapid development, especially those related to service availability, which has grown into a significant obstacle to be overcome. Denial of service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the threats that can disturb even inactivate the functionalities of the IoT networks, like their ability to collect, process, and transfer data. To date, many methods have been proposed to identify, detect, and mitigate such attacks in the IoT domain, while many surveys have been conducted to review and classify these solutions. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has conducted a holistic study to review, classify, and correlate both theoretical and practical aspects used in the design and validation of those approaches.
To address this need, we have examined recent and noteworthy research on DoS and DDoS attacks, resulting in the selection of 80 papers to be considered in our study. As a starting point, after identifying in-depth the theoretical aspects commonly used in the detection of such attacks, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies them. In the second step, we inventoried and produced a complete classification of all the practical aspects used in the validation and evaluation of detection and mitigation approaches, including methods, testbeds, hardware, software, datasets, libraries, and metrics. In the third step, we conducted a technical analysis of the surveyed literature by considering different aspects. As a final step, we perform a statistical analysis in order to discuss various research questions that strive to provide a better insight of the prevalent tendencies in this domain by exploring, for each attack, the most appropriate approach and validation process to consider in dealing with it. The main findings of this analysis show that the research is leaning towards using machine learning, mainly by considering supervised algorithms to detect different variants of flooding attacks. Moreover, simulation appears to be the most operated method to validate the surveyed literature while analytical and empiric validations have been seldom adopted mainly to evaluate classical approaches to detect perception layer attacks.

DDoS family: A novel perspective for massive types of DDoS attacks

Abstract
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense is a profound research problem. In recent years, adversaries tend to complicate their attack strategies by crafting vast DDoS variants. On the one hand, this trend exacerbates both extremes of classification granularity (i.e., binary and attack level) in existing machine learning methods. On the other hand, massive attack categories make the filter rule table bulky, as well as cause problems of slow reaction presented in the recent state-of-the-art DDoS mitigation system. Therefore, we propose the concept of a DDoS family to reconcile/cope with these issues. The specific technical roadmap includes traffic pattern characterization, attack fingerprint production, and cross-executed family partition by community detection. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposal in terms of portraying similarities, guiding model classification/unknown attack detection, optimizing defense strategies, and speeding filtering reactions. For instance, our results show that using only one rule can defend 15 types of attacks due to their homogeneous behavioral representation. Particularly, we find the interesting observation that counting the backward packet is more efficient and robust against some attacks (e.g., Tor's Hammer Attack), which is very different from previous solutions.

A hybrid deep learning model for detecting DDoS flooding attacks in SIP-based systems

Abstract
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for multimedia communication as a signaling protocol to manage, establish, maintain, and terminate multimedia sessions among participants. However, SIP is vulnerable to attacks due to its text-based nature and the lack of adequate security measures. One of the most damaging attacks is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which consumes resources and blocks legitimate users from accessing the available services. Although various machine learning-based schemes have been proposed to detect DDoS flooding attacks in SIP-based systems, most of them only address INVITE flooding attacks. REGISTER and ACK flooding attacks were not addressed. On the other hand, schemes based on statistical analysis are not sufficiently accurate. In this article, we propose a novel approach classifying DDoS flooding attacks in SIP-based systems using a combination of deep learning and entropy techniques. The proposed approach consists of two components: a hybrid deep learning model and an entropy-based model. The hybrid deep learning model combines convolutional neural networks and a stacked bidirectional long short-term memory network to extract features and classify traffic patterns. The entropy-based model measures the randomness and diversity of traffic flows using Shannon and Rényi entropies. To validate the proposed scheme, we built a balanced dataset of different types and intensities of DDoS flooding attacks. The results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively detect DDoS flooding attacks with high accuracy and low detection time for various attack intensities. Moreover, it surpasses other related schemes in terms of accuracy and detection time.

Foggier skies, clearer clouds: A real-time IoT-DDoS attack mitigation framework in fog-assisted software-defined cyber-physical systems


Methods
The paper offers a five-stage defense framework for building a mitigation against IoT-based DDoS attacks. The article brings forth an amalgamated dataset concocted from InSDN, BoT-IoT, and UNSW-Sydney datasets and a simulated dataset for IoT-DDoS to the research community. The paper employs a multi-stage Stack-Ensembled framework at the heart of the solution pillared on physical devices' behavioral attributes, resulting in a universal defense approach. The experiment leverages fog computing with distributed computational nodes to reduce response latency. Furthermore, the paper implements attack-detection-as-a-service on top of the Docker framework for a cost-effective, reusable, and portable framework. The novel design of the framework presents a light mitigation scheme to the SDN controller, ensuring a negligible impact on the controller's performance.

A deep learning technique to detect distributed denial of service attacks in software-defined networks
Abstract
Software-Defined Network (SDN) is an established networking paradigm that separates the control plane from the data plane. It has central network control, and programmability facilities, therefore SDN can improve network flexibility, management, performance, and scalability. The programmability and control centralization of SDN have improved network functions but also exposed it to security challenges such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that target both control and data planes. This paper proposes an effective detection technique against DDoS attack in SDN control plane and data plane. For the control plane, the technique detects DDoS attacks through a Deep Learning (DL) model using new features extracted from traffic statistics. A DL method (AE-BGRU) for DDoS detection uses Autoencoder (AE) with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU). The proposed features for the control plane include unknown IP destination address, packets inter-arrival time, Transport layer protocol (TLP) header, and Type of service (ToS) header. For the data plane, the technique tracks the switch's average arrival bit rate with an unknown destination address in the data plane. Then, the technique detects DDoS attacks through a DL-based model which also uses AE with BGRU. The proposed features in the data plane include the switch's stored capacity, the average rate of packets with unknown destination addresses, the IP Options header, and the average number of flows. The dataset is generated from feature extraction and computations from normal and attack packets and used with the classifier. Also, additional Machine Learning (ML) methods are used to enhance the detection process. If the model detects an attack, the technique mitigates DDoS effects by updating the user's trust value and blocking suspicious senders based on the trust value. The experimental results proved that compared to related techniques, the suggested method had a higher accuracy and lower false alarm rate.

Introducing packet-level analysis in programmable data planes to advance Network Intrusion Detection

Abstract
Programmable data planes offer precise control over the low-level processing steps applied to network packets, serving as a valuable tool for analysing malicious flows in the field of intrusion detection. Albeit with limitations on physical resources and capabilities, they allow for the efficient extraction of detailed traffic information, which can then be utilised by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms responsible for identifying security threats. In addressing resource constraints, existing solutions in the literature rely on compressing network data through the collection of statistical traffic features in the data plane. While this compression saves memory resources in switches and minimises the burden on the control channel between the data and the control plane, it also results in a loss of information available to the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), limiting access to packet payload, categorical features, and the semantic understanding of network communications, such as the behaviour of packets within traffic flows. This paper proposes P4DDLe, a framework that exploits the flexibility of P4-based programmable data planes for packet-level feature extraction and pre-processing. P4DDLe leverages the programmable data plane to extract raw packet features from the network traffic, categorical features included, and to organise them in a way that the semantics of traffic flows are preserved. To minimise memory and control channel overheads, P4DDLe selectively processes and filters packet-level data, so that only the features required by the NIDS are collected. The experimental evaluation with recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack data demonstrates that the proposed approach is very efficient in collecting compact and high-quality representations of network flows, ensuring precise detection of DDoS attacks.

Detection of application-layer DDoS attacks using machine learning and genetic algorithms

Abstract
Application-layer Distributed Denial of Service (App-DDoS) attacks continue to be a pervasive problem in cybersecurity, despite the availability of various defensive frameworks. This research addresses the challenges associated with App-DDoS detection and presents a highly effective and adaptable solution for detecting various types of App-DDoS attacks. Motivated by the critical need for improved DDoS detection, our approach achieves dual objectives by accurately detecting both known and unknown DDoS attacks while minimizing false alarms. To achieve this, we combine Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and a human with expertise in DDoS to enhance the system's resilience against evolving attack patterns. Furthermore, we prioritize high-quality data curation by utilizing multiple datasets, CICIDS2017 and CICDDoS2019, and incorporating GMM to adapt effectively to varying data distributions over time. In addition, we propose a comprehensive feature selection strategy that addresses the false alarm rate and improves classifier performance by utilizing decision tree (DT) feature importance and the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) approach. Moreover, we adopt genetic algorithms (GA) for automated hyper-parameter optimization to ensure efficient and effective DDoS detection. Quantitative analysis shows a significant reduction in false alarms to 0.12% (52 out of 45,149 samples), with the RF classifier achieving outstanding accuracy (99.9%), precision (100%), recall (99.8%), and F1 score (99.9%). Handling unknown App-DDoS attacks, our approach demonstrates remarkable performance across all datasets.

HTTP request pattern based signatures for early application layer DDoS detection: A firewall agnostic approach

Abstract
Application Layer DDoS (AL-DDoS) attacks are an extremely dangerous variety of DDoS attacks that started becoming popular recently. They are executed using very few legitimate requests, making them very difficult to detect. Since they are executed using attack generation tools and botnets, AL-DDoS attacks display similarity within a request stream (temporal similarity) and across request streams (spatial similarity). Once a particular request stream has been detected as malicious by an anomaly detection mechanism (ADM), spatial similarity can help in detecting AL-DDoS attacks much earlier by employing a dynamic signature based approach. In this work, we use HTTP request patterns as signatures to build a firewall agnostic Early Detection Module (EDM) for AL-DDoS attacks. We also propose the use of Sample Entropy instead of the popular Shannon’s Entropy to identify AL-DDoS attacks. Sample Entropy is able to model both the frequencies and sequence of data items within a request stream, and is a better indicator of temporal similarity than Shannon’s Entropy. In this work, we demonstrate that Sample Entropy can be used effectively to detect AL-DDoS attacks. With a Sample Entropy based anomaly detection mechanism, we demonstrate that the use of EDM significantly reduces the detection latency for AL-DDoS attacks.

Detection and defense of application-layer DDoS attacks in backbone web traffic

Abstract
Web servers are usually located in a well-organized data center where these servers connect with the outside Internet directly through backbones. Meanwhile, the application-layer distributed denials of service (AL-DDoS) attacks are critical threats to the Internet, particularly to those business web servers. Currently, there are some methods designed to handle the AL-DDoS attacks, but most of them cannot be used in heavy backbones. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect AL-DDoS attacks. Our work distinguishes itself from previous methods by considering AL-DDoS attack detection in heavy backbone traffic. Besides, the detection of AL-DDoS attacks is easily misled by flash crowd traffic. In order to overcome this problem, our proposed method constructs a Real-time Frequency Vector (RFV) and real-timely characterizes the traffic as a set of models. By examining the entropy of AL-DDoS attacks and flash crowds, these models can be used to recognize the real AL-DDoS attacks. We integrate the above detection principles into a modularized defense architecture, which consists of a head-end sensor, a detection module and a traffic filter. With a swift AL-DDoS detection speed, the filter is capable of letting the legitimate requests through but the attack traffic is stopped. In the experiment, we adopt certain episodes of real traffic from Sina and Taobao to evaluate our AL-DDoS detection method and architecture. Compared with previous methods, the results show that our approach is very effective in defending AL-DDoS attacks at backbones.

MLP-GA based algorithm to detect application layer DDoS attack

Abstract
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is transforming into a weapon by the attackers, politicians, and cyber terrorists, etc. Today there is a quick ascent in the exploration field of mitigation and guard against DDoS attacks, however in actuality; the capabilities of the hackers are additionally growing. From early news of focusing on the network and transport layer, now a day’s application layer becomes the point of convergence of the attacks. In the paper, we first analyze the features from incoming packets. These features include Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) count, the number of the Internet Protocol (IP) address during a time window, the constant mapping of the port number and frame of the packets. In the paper, we write all the combinations of these metrics and then analyzed the client’s behaviors from the public attack and normal data sets. We use Environmental Protection Agency-Hypertext Transfer Protocol (EPA-HTTP) DDoS, Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) 2007 and experimentally produced DDoS data set using Slowloris attack to draw the efficiency and effectiveness of the features for layer seven DDoS detection. Second, we employ Multilayer Perceptron with a Genetic Algorithm (MLP-GA) to estimate the efficiency of the detection using the metrics. The experimental results show that MLP-GA provides the best efficiency of 98.04% for detecting the layer seven DDoS attacks. The proposed method provides a minimum value of False Positive when compared with traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network, MLP, J48, and C45, etc.

HTTP flood attack detection in application layer using machine learning metrics and bio inspired bat algorithm

Abstract
The internet network is mostly victimized to the Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack, which is one that intentionally occupies the computing resources and bandwidth in order to deny that services to potential users. The attack scenario is to flood the packets immensely. If the attack source is single, then the attack is referred as denial of service (DOS) and if attack is sourced from divergent servers, then it is referred as DDOS. Over a decade many of the researchers considered the detection and prevention of DDOS attack as research objective and succeeded to deliver few significant DDOS detection and prevention strategies. How fast and early detection of DDOS attack is done in streaming network transactions is still a significant research objective in present level of internet usage. Unfortunately the current benchmarking DDOS attack detection strategies are failing to justify the objective called “fast and early detection of DDOS attack”. In order to this, in this paper we devised a Bio-Inspired Anomaly based application layer DDoS attack (App-DDOS Attack) detection that is in the aim of achieving fast and early detection. The proposed model is a bio-inspired bat algorithm that used to achieve the fast and early detection of the App-DDOS by HTTP flood. The experiments were carried out on bench marking CAIDA dataset and the results delivered are boosting the significance of the proposed model to achieve the objective of the paper.

User behavior analytics-based classification of application layer HTTP-GET flood attacks

Abstract
Web services are one of the most prominent forms of web presence exercised by the businesses to connect to their possible client base. GET flood attacks, commonly known as Application Layer DDoS attacks, are widely executed exploits that challenge almost all the web servers hosting such services on the Internet. The state-of-art literature provides many security mechanisms that are designed to handle such attacks, however, attackers constantly explore unique approaches for orchestrating covert GET flood attacks. The detection of such attacks requires user level monitoring due to a high resemblance among the browsing behaviors of legitimate users and modern-day sophisticated bots. In this paper, we propose four novel behavioral features to distinguish GET flood attack sources from the legitimate normal and flash traffic. Our work distinguishes itself from previous works by providing a comprehensive solution for the detection of 12 different strategies employed by an attacker to launch GET flood attacks. We build an experimental test bed supported by well-known software tools that replay the benchmark web logs and generate emulated attack traces pertaining to GET flood attack strategies. The datasets prepared during the course of this experimentation are evaluated through an exhaustive performance comparison of the selected set of machine learning classifiers. The obtained results evidently indicate significantly high detection accuracy (97.46%) with few false alarms using the SVM classifier.

Slow denial-of-service attacks on software defined networks

Abstract
Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a network paradigm that decouples the network’s control plane, delegated to the SDN controller, from the data plane, delegated to SDN switches.
For increased efficiency, SDN switches use a high-performance Ternary Content-Addressable memory (TCAM) to install rules. However, due to the TCAM’s high cost and power consumption, switches have a limited amount of TCAM memory. Consequently, a limited number of rules can be installed. This limitation has been exploited to carry out Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, such as Saturation attacks, that generate large amounts of traffic. Inspired by slow application layer DDoS attacks, this paper presents and investigates DDoS attacks on SDN that do not require large amounts of traffic, thus bypassing existing defenses that are triggered by traffic volume.
In particular, we offer two slow attacks on SDN. The first attack, called Slow TCAM Exhaustion attack (Slow-TCAM), is able to consume all SDN switch’s TCAM memory by forcing the installation of new forwarding rules and maintaining them indeterminately active, thus disallowing new rules to be installed to serve legitimate clients.
The second attack, called Slow Saturation attack, combines Slow-TCAM attack with a lower rate instance of the Saturation attack. A Slow Saturation attack is capable of denying service using a fraction of the traffic of typical Saturation attacks. Moreover, the Slow Saturation attack can also impact installed legitimate rules, thus causing a greater impact than the Slow-TCAM attack. In addition, it also affects the availability of other network’s components, e.g., switches, even the ones not being directly targeted by the attack, as has been proven by our experiments. We propose a number of variations of these attacks and demonstrate their effectiveness by means of an extensive experimental evaluation. The Slow-TCAM is able to deny service to legitimate clients requiring only 38 s and sending less than 40 packets per second without abruptly changing network resources, such as CPU and memory. Moreover, besides denying service as a Slow-TCAM attack, the Slow Saturation attack can also disrupt multiple SDN switches (not only the targeted ones) by sending a lower-rate traffic when compared to current known Saturation attacks

DDoS attack detection in Internet of Things using recurrent neural network

Abstract
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging communication paradigm due to its wide range of applications. For IoT, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are becoming increasingly widespread, and the solutions to combat these attacks are in increased demand. The significant contributions of this paper include offering a novel algorithm named DALCNN (Detecting Attack using Live Capture Neural Network) for detecting DDoS attacks in IoT using the concept of recurrent neural network and implementation of a Software-defined-Network (SDN) using OpenDayLight platform. Furthermore, a three-tier architecture is proposed to classify and detect DDoS attacks. The algorithm classifies the kind of attack using a novel activation function and the machine/deep learning concepts. The proposed classifier is tested on 177 instances. The Simulation was carried out using the tools such as Mininet, Wireshark to generate the DDoS attack and accurately detect the different types of DDoS attacks in the network. The simulation results reveal that the values of benchmark parameters – accuracy, true positive rate, false-positive rate, precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC-area are: 99.98%, 0.999, 0.01, 0.999, 0.999, 0.999, and 0.999, respectively. Apart from it, the network performance evaluation of the various open-source controllers’ including Floodlight, Ryu, ONOS, and the OpenDayLight based on the performance metrics – Throughput, Latency, and Aggregate Controller performance as well was carried out. The Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently compared to the other existing algorithms. The proposed OpenDayLight controller performs way better than the other open-source controllers.

A low-rate DDoS detection and mitigation for SDN using Renyi Entropy with Packet Drop

Abstract
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to network architecture that enables software applications used for intelligent, centralized network management or scheduling. It is gaining popularity due to its flexibility, agility, and scalability feature. SDN provides high network programmability and speeds up the network variation by forwarding the control layer from the data layer. The logically centralized controller is always an attractive target for the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. According to various specifications, the low-rate DDoS attack is often not easy to detect against SDN because attackers behave like legitimate traffic. Hence, it is essential to have a fast and accurate detection model to detect the data layer attack traffic timely so that it could not affect on available resources such as bandwidth, memory, central processing unit (CPU). In this paper, we propose a DDoS detection technique based on Renyi Entropy with Packet Drop (REPD) where packets drop method is used for the purpose of mitigation. The information distance metric has been used to evaluate the fluctuation of network traffic with various probability distributions. Also, an extensive simulation has been carried out on the synthetic data to improve the performance in terms of detection time and accuracy. It was observed that the attained results outperformed the Shannon Entropy (SE), Generalized Entropy, and other statistical distance metrics.

# Chapter 2: Theoretical Framework

## 2.1 Basic Concepts

In this section, we will lay the foundation for understanding the nature of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by defining what they are and exploring the common attack vectors through which they are carried out.

### Definition of DDoS Attacks

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Devices that can be used in such attacks include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices.

### DDoS Attack Vectors

DDoS attacks come in different forms and use various vectors. Some of the most commonly known vectors include:

- **Volume Based Attacks**: This includes UDP floods, ICMP floods, and other spoofed packet floods. The goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site.
- **Protocol Attacks**: These attacks consume actual server resources or those of intermediate communication equipment, such as firewalls and load balancers. They include SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks, Ping of Death, etc.
- **Application Layer Attacks**: These involve requests that result in the failure of the application layer processes. Examples include HTTP GET or POST floods.

## 2.2 DDoS Impact Analysis

DDoS attacks can have serious implications on businesses and services. In this subsection, we delve into the effects they carry and discuss several high-profile case studies.

### Effects on Businesses and Services

The impact of a DDoS attack on a business or service can range from temporary disruption of services to long-term damage that includes loss of customer trust, data theft, and financial losses. Critical infrastructure, online services, and even governments can become incapacitated. Some potential effects include:

- **Operational Disruption**: Interruption of online operations, leading to inability to access critical digital assets.
- **Financial Losses**: Direct losses from halted transactions, as well as indirect costs due to mitigation efforts, recovery, and decreased consumer confidence.
- **Reputational Damage**: Long-lasting effect on a company's image and reputation.

### Case Studies of Major DDoS Incidents

To illustrate these effects, two significant case studies of DDoS attacks are reviewed:

1. The attack on Dyn DNS in October 2016, which disrupted major sites like Twitter, Netflix, and CNN.
2. The 2020 attack on Amazon Web Services, considered one of the largest DDoS attacks in history, peaking at 2.3 Tbps.

## 2.3 Existing Defense Mechanisms

It is crucial to understand the different strategies and tools available for defending against DDoS attacks. Here, we evaluate current methodologies, along with their strengths and weaknesses.

### Current Strategies and Tools

Some commonly implemented strategies to mitigate DDoS attacks include:

- **Overprovisioning Bandwidth**: This provides a cushion against volume-based attacks but is not cost-effective.
- **Scrubbing Centers**: Specialized facilities where traffic is analyzed, and malicious packets are 'scrubbed' off.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: By distributing network traffic across many servers, CDNs can absorb larger volumes of traffic.
- **Front-end Hardware**: Hardware that can provide immediate DDoS protection by analyzing data packets as they enter the system.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

While each defense mechanism has its advantages, there are also shortcomings. For instance, overprovisioning cannot counter sophisticated layer 7 attacks. Scrubbing centers might introduce latency, and hardware solutions require significant investment and can become outdated. CDNs, although effective for large scale distribution, might not protect against targeted application-layer attacks.

This comprehensive analysis of the theoretical framework surrounding DDoS attacks sets the stage for discussing the methodology and practical applications in the subsequent chapters of this thesis.


## Modern DDoS Attack Characteristics

Modern DDoS attacks have evolved to be more sophisticated, persistent, and larger in scale than their predecessors. Below we outline several characteristics that define contemporary attacks, along with a popular attack event that exemplifies these characteristics.

### Multi-Vector Attacks

Modern DDoS attacks often combine multiple attack vectors to disrupt the target. By diversifying the methods of attack, cybercriminals can circumvent defensive measures that may only cover specific types of attacks.

### Amplification Techniques

Attackers use amplification techniques to generate large volumes of traffic. This involves leveraging vulnerable servers on the internet to amplify the attack's size without necessitating a significant number of initial machines.

### Botnet Size and IoT Exploitation

The size of botnets used for modern DDoS attacks has grown, partially due to the exploitation of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which are often easier to compromise and integrate into a botnet.

### Application Layer Focus

Contemporary DDoS assaults also increasingly target the application layer, where they can cause server overload with fewer resources compared to volumetric layer 3/4 attacks.

### Shorter Duration but Higher Frequency

Today's attacks might be shorter in duration but can occur more frequently, causing repeated disruptions that require constant vigilance.

### Encryption-Based Attacks

Some modern attacks utilize encrypted traffic, making it harder for defensive systems to inspect and filter malicious content without impacting overall network performance.

### Dynamic IP Attacks

Attackers now use methods that cycle through different IP addresses, making it more challenging for defenders to block malicious traffic without affecting legitimate users.

### Popular Attack Event: Mirai Botnet

The Mirai botnet is an example of a modern DDoS attack that possesses many of these characteristics. In October 2016, it targeted the DNS provider Dyn, leading to widespread internet outages for major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit.

**Characteristics Exemplified by Mirai:**

- **Botnet of IoT Devices**: The attack was powered by a large amount of compromised IoT devices such as security cameras, DVRs, and routers.
  
- **High Traffic Volumes**: The attack generated extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, estimated to be at over 1 Tbps.
  
- **Dynamic Attack Patterns**: Utilizing built-in randomness of attacking IPs and domain name queries, the Mirai malware thwarted simple IP-based defense mechanisms.
  
- **Multi-Vector Approach**: The Mirai botnet used multiple types of attack traffic, including SYN floods, GET/POST floods, and others, to increase its effectiveness.

The Mirai botnet attack highlighted the vulnerability of IoT devices and demonstrated the destructive potential of modern DDoS attack strategies. This event led to a reevaluation of security practices surrounding network-connected devices and put a spotlight on the importance of DDoS mitigation techniques that can handle such sophisticated attacks.


A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers strategically positioned in various geographic locations to deliver web content more efficiently to users. CDNs are designed to improve the performance, reliability, and security of delivering content such as web pages, images, videos, and other media over the internet. Here are some key aspects of CDNs:

1. **Content Caching and Delivery:** CDNs cache (store) copies of website content on their servers distributed across different locations. When a user requests content, the CDN delivers it from the server closest to the user, reducing the distance the data needs to travel and thereby improving the loading speed.

2. **Load Distribution:** CDNs help distribute the load on the origin server by serving content from the closest edge server, reducing the strain on the origin server and improving its overall performance and availability.

3. **Improved Performance:** By delivering content from servers closer to the user, CDNs reduce latency and improve the overall loading speed of web pages and media, resulting in a better user experience.

4. **Scalability and Reliability:** CDNs provide scalability to handle traffic spikes and ensure reliability by reducing the risk of downtime due to server overloads or network congestion.

5. **Security and DDoS Protection:** Many CDNs offer security features, such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, and web application firewall (WAF) capabilities to safeguard websites and content from cyber threats.

6. **Analytics and Reporting:** CDNs often provide analytics and reporting tools that offer insights into website traffic, user behavior, and content performance, helping website owners optimize their content delivery strategies.

Overall, CDNs play a crucial role in enhancing the speed, availability, and security of web content, making them an essential component for delivering a seamless and reliable user experience on websites, especially for global audiences.


Scrubbing centers, in the context of network security and DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection, are facilities or services that specialize in mitigating and filtering malicious traffic and attacks aimed at disrupting the availability of online services.

Here are key aspects of scrubbing centers:

1. **DDoS Mitigation:** Scrubbing centers are equipped with advanced hardware and software solutions designed to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. These attacks attempt to overwhelm a target server or network with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.

2. **Traffic Filtering:** When a DDoS attack is detected, the traffic is diverted to the scrubbing center, where it undergoes intensive filtering. The center's systems analyze the incoming traffic, distinguishing between legitimate and malicious requests, and then discard or "scrub" the harmful traffic while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through.

3. **Global Network:** Many scrubbing centers have a global presence with multiple locations strategically distributed across different geographic regions. This allows them to handle and mitigate DDoS attacks closer to the source of the attack, reducing latency and improving the overall effectiveness of the mitigation process.

4. **Scalability and Redundancy:** Scrubbing centers are designed to handle large volumes of traffic and are often built with redundancy and failover capabilities to ensure continuous protection even during high-intensity attacks or in the event of hardware or network failures.

5. **Managed Services:** Some organizations opt for managed DDoS protection services provided by scrubbing centers, allowing them to outsource the monitoring and mitigation of DDoS attacks to experienced security professionals.

6. **Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting:** Scrubbing centers typically offer real-time monitoring and reporting capabilities, providing insights into attack patterns, traffic trends, and the effectiveness of the mitigation process. This information helps organizations understand the nature of the threats they face and make informed decisions about their security posture.

Overall, scrubbing centers play a critical role in safeguarding online services from the disruptive impact of DDoS attacks, helping organizations maintain the availability and performance of their digital assets.


Overprovisioning bandwidth refers to the practice of provisioning or allocating more network bandwidth capacity than is currently required by an organization's typical traffic load. This approach is used to ensure that the network can accommodate traffic spikes, unexpected increases in demand, and future growth without experiencing performance degradation or network congestion.

Key aspects of overprovisioning bandwidth include:

1. **Capacity Planning:** Network administrators and IT professionals analyze historical traffic patterns, anticipated growth, and potential peak usage scenarios to determine the appropriate level of bandwidth overprovisioning needed to accommodate fluctuations in demand.

2. **Traffic Spikes and Peaks:** Overprovisioning allows the network to handle sudden increases in traffic, such as during promotional events, product launches, or seasonal peaks, without impacting the user experience due to network congestion.

3. **Redundancy and Resilience:** Overprovisioning can provide redundancy and resilience in the network, ensuring that there is ample capacity available in case of hardware failures, link outages, or unexpected events that could impact the network's normal operation.

4. **Quality of Service (QoS):** By overprovisioning bandwidth, organizations can maintain a high quality of service for critical applications, real-time communications, and other latency-sensitive traffic, even during periods of high demand.

5. **Future Growth:** Overprovisioning allows organizations to accommodate future growth and expansion without the immediate need to upgrade network infrastructure, providing scalability and flexibility for evolving business needs.

6. **Cost Considerations:** While overprovisioning bandwidth can provide benefits in terms of performance and resilience, it's important for organizations to balance the benefits against the associated costs, as overprovisioning may result in underutilized capacity during normal operating conditions.

Overall, overprovisioning bandwidth is a proactive strategy to ensure that the network can handle increased demand and unexpected events, maintaining a high level of performance and availability for critical applications and services.


## Modern Defense Mechanisms Against DDoS Attacks

In the wake of increasingly sophisticated DDoS attacks, a variety of defense mechanisms have been developed to protect networks and services. These strategies are designed to mitigate the impact of attacks and ensure continued service availability. Here's an overview of some modern defense mechanisms:

### Advanced Traffic Filtering

- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)**: Inspects the content of data packets to distinguish between legitimate traffic and potential threats.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitors traffic patterns to identify anomalies that may indicate an attack, allowing for proactive mitigation.

### Hybrid DDoS Protection

- Combines both on-premises and cloud-based solutions to provide comprehensive protection. On-premises equipment handles smaller-scale attacks while cloud-based services can absorb larger traffic spikes.

### Scalable Cloud-Based Scrubbing Centers

- Enterprises can redirect traffic through scrubbing centers provided by DDoS mitigation services. These centers cleanse the traffic by filtering out malicious packets and only passing on legitimate ones.

### Rate Limiting

- Imposes limits on the number of requests a server will accept over a certain time frame. This prevents systems from becoming overwhelmed during an attack.

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- A WAF adds a protective layer between the web application and the internet, inspecting HTTP/HTTPS requests and blocking those that are malicious.

### Anomaly Detection Systems

- Utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect and respond to unusual traffic behaviors that could indicate a DDoS attack.

### Edge Network Distribution

- Spreads out resources across multiple geographic locations to reduce the impact of a DDoS attack targeting a single point of presence.

### IP Blacklisting

- Blocks traffic from known malicious IP addresses and allows users to manually blacklist IPs that have exhibited suspicious behavior.

### DNS Routing and Management

- Manages DNS responses to distribute load and employs security measures to prevent DNS-targeted attacks.

### Redundant Infrastructure

- Ensures there are backup systems in place so that if one server or data center is attacked, others can handle the load without disrupting services.

### BGP FlowSpec

- Allows quicker and more flexible reaction to DDoS attacks by enabling the sharing of traffic flow specifications among network peers.

### Emergency Response Teams

- Some organizations maintain dedicated teams ready to respond to DDoS attacks, coordinating efforts across different departments and with external mitigation services.

### Regular Security Audits and Updates

- Ongoing assessment of the security posture to patch vulnerabilities, update software, and refine defensive strategies.

### Incident Response Plan

- A well-defined plan that outlines the steps to take before, during, and after a DDoS attack to minimize damage and recover quickly.

Combining multiple defense mechanisms is often the most effective way to defend against modern DDoS attacks. No single strategy is foolproof, but together they can provide layers of defense that make it difficult for attackers to succeed. It's also crucial for organizations to keep abreast of the latest trends and technologies in DDoS attacks and defenses, as the landscape is continually evolving.


## Generation and Development Process of DDoS Attacks

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks have undergone significant evolution over the years, becoming more complex and harder to mitigate. The development of a DDoS attack typically follows these phases:

### 1. Target Identification
- **Selection**: Attackers identify a target. This could be a specific website, online service, or network.

### 2. Attack Strategy
- **Type of Attack**: Choose from various attack methods, such as volumetric, protocol, or application-layer attacks.
- **Tools and Techniques**: Decide on the tools and techniques for generating traffic (e.g., botnets, amplification techniques).

### 3. Botnet Creation
- **Infection**: Attackers create a botnet by infecting multiple devices with malware. These infected devices are called "bots" or "zombies."
- **Control Mechanism**: Implement a command and control (C&C) system to remotely manage the bots.

### 4. Amplification (Optional)
- **Exploit Vulnerabilities**: Some attacks use amplification techniques to multiply traffic by exploiting vulnerable servers (e.g., DNS, NTP).
- **Reflection**: Exploit legitimate services to redirect and amplify traffic towards the target.

### 5. Execution
- **Initial Test**: Perform small-scale attacks to test effectiveness and defense systems.
- **Actual Attack**: Launch the full-scale DDoS attack against the target, initiated by the attacker's command.

### 6. Monitoring and Adaptation
- **Observe Impact**: Monitor the effectiveness of the attack and the response from the targeted organization or mitigation services.
- **Modify Tactics**: Adjust strategies in real-time to circumvent defenses or to maintain the effectiveness of the attack.

### 7. Expansion (If Necessary)
- **Recruitment**: If necessary, enlarge the botnet by compromising more devices to increase attack power.
- **Secondary Attacks**: Sometimes, secondary attacks are launched to distract or further overwhelm the target's resources.
   
### 8. Termination
- **Command Withdrawal**: The attacker stops the attack by ceasing commands to the bots, whether the goal was achieved or due to external pressures (e.g., law enforcement action).

### Post-Attack Phase
- **Analysis**: Attackers may analyze the outcome for future improvement.
- **Data Theft**: In some cases, attackers combine DDoS attacks with data breaches.

Throughout these stages, attackers may continuously evolve their strategies to bypass modern defensive mechanisms. Development in DDoS tactics often includes:

- **Automation**: Using scripts and automated tools to find and exploit vulnerabilities at scale.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Employing advanced technologies to adapt to defenses dynamically.
- **Multi-Vector Attacks**: Combining different types of attack vectors to complicate defense.

Each generation of DDoS attacks becomes increasingly sophisticated, leveraging new vulnerabilities and adapting to changes in technology and infrastructure. Consequently, organizations must constantly improve their defensive strategies to protect against the dynamic nature of DDoS threats.


DDoS attacks have evolved through several generations, each marked by the introduction of new techniques and methods. Below is a broad generational classification that provides an overview of how DDoS attacks have matured over time:

### First Generation – Basic Flooding Attacks
- **Characteristics**: Simple, brute-force attempts to overwhelm a target with high volumes of traffic.
- **Example Attacks**: ICMP flood (Ping flood), UDP flood.

### Second Generation – Protocol Exploit Attacks
- **Characteristics**: Utilize weaknesses in the protocol stack to consume server resources or network bandwidth.
- **Example Attacks**: SYN flood (part of the TCP three-way handshake), Smurf attack (amplification using IP broadcast addressing).

### Third Generation – Application Layer Attacks
- **Characteristics**: Target specific aspects of application servers; aim to exhaust server resources rather than network bandwidth.
- **Example Attacks**: HTTP GET/POST floods, Slowloris (holding connections open).

### Fourth Generation – Multi-vector Attacks
- **Characteristics**: Combine different attack types simultaneously to confuse the defense and amplify impact.
- **Example Attacks**: Simultaneous volumetric and application layer attacks.

### Fifth Generation – Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS)
- **Characteristics**: Long-term assault on multiple targets, employing advanced strategies and persistently adapting to countermeasures.
- **Example Attacks**: Highly sophisticated multi-vector attacks with evasion techniques.

This generational classification outlines the evolution of strategy and complexity in DDoS attacks. It's important to note that these generations can overlap, and elements from one generation might still be used within newer generations. Additionally, attackers are always seeking novel approaches, so this classification will continue to evolve as new techniques emerge.


### First Generation – Basic Flooding Attacks

**Characteristics**:
- High-volume traffic that overwhelms network bandwidth.
- Direct attacks against the availability of resources.
- Simplicity in execution needing minimal sophistication.
- Can be mitigated by having excess bandwidth and simple filtering rules.

**Example Attack – ICMP Flood (Ping flood)**:
- **Description**: The attacker overwhelms the victim's network with ICMP Echo Request (ping) packets. This makes it difficult for legitimate traffic to be processed and can result in network slowdowns or complete outages.
- **Mitigation**: Filtering ICMP packets, setting rate limits, and using anti-DDoS services.

### Second Generation – Protocol Exploit Attacks

**Characteristics**:
- Exploitation of protocol weaknesses, often in the TCP/IP suite.
- Consumption of server or network equipment resources (e.g., CPU, memory).
- Requires a bit more sophistication and knowledge of networking protocols.

**Example Attack – SYN Flood**:
- **Description**: By sending a succession of TCP SYN requests and never completing the three-way handshake with an ACK, attackers can leave connections hanging. This consumes server resources and can prevent new legitimate connections from being established.
- **Mitigation**: Configuring SYN cookies, increasing backlog queue sizes, and deploying firewalls that can recognize and drop malicious SYN packets.

### Third Generation – Application Layer Attacks

**Characteristics**:
- Targets the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model).
- Designed to exhaust the resources of web servers, databases, and other applications.
- Difficult to detect as they can mimic legitimate user behavior.

**Example Attack – HTTP GET/POST Flood**:
- **Description**: The attacker sends numerous HTTP GET or POST requests to overload the web server. These requests are designed to retrieve data-intensive pages or submit forms, thus exhausting the application server.
- **Mitigation**: Employing Web Application Firewalls (WAF), rate limiting, anomaly detection, and challenge-response authentication mechanisms like CAPTCHAs.

### Fourth Generation – Multi-vector Attacks

**Characteristics**:
- Concurrent use of multiple attack vectors (volumetric, protocol, and application layer attacks).
- Sophistication in targeting different infrastructure components at once.
- Challenging for defenders due to the simultaneous diversification of attack methods.

**Example Attack – Simultaneous Volumetric and Application Layer Attacks**:
- **Description**: An attacker may launch a volumetric UDP flood to saturate the network bandwidth while also executing a Slowloris attack to keep web server connections open indefinitely, requiring defenses to cope with issues at both the network and application layers.
- **Mitigation**: Multi-layered security approaches, adaptive DDoS protection systems, and comprehensive monitoring to identify and mitigate diverse threat vectors.

### Fifth Generation – Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS)

**Characteristics**:
- Targeted, strategic assaults often aimed at high-profile targets such as financial institutions or governmental agencies.
- Use of evasion techniques to bypass standard defense mechanisms.
- Long-term approach, adapting to defender's responses, and often cycling through attack vectors.

**Example Attack – Highly Sophisticated Multi-vector Attacks with Evasion Techniques**:
- **Description**: APDoS attacks might use combinations of encrypted attacks, mimic user behavior to evade detection, and employ botnets for amplification and persistence, often switching tactics to stay ahead of defensive measures.
- **Mitigation**: Extensive, continuous security analysis, deployment of advanced behavioral analytics, incident response teams, and cooperation with ISPs and cloud-based DDoS mitigation services.

In conclusion, each generation of DDoS attacks reflects an evolution in strategy, complexity, and sophistication. Defenders must continuously adapt their security postures to anticipate future developments and safeguard their networks and services against the ever-changing landscape of DDoS threats.

- Exploitation of protocol weaknesses, often in the TCP/IP suite.
- Consumption of server or network equipment resources (e.g., CPU, memory).
- Requires a bit more sophistication and knowledge of networking protocols.

**Example Attack – SYN Flood**:
- **Description**: By sending a succession of TCP SYN requests and never completing the three-way handshake with an ACK, attackers can leave connections hanging. This consumes server resources and can prevent new legitimate connections from being established.
- **Mitigation**: Configuring SYN cookies, increasing backlog queue sizes, and deploying firewalls that can recognize and drop malicious SYN packets.

### Third Generation – Application Layer Attacks

**Characteristics**:
- Targets the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model).
- Designed to exhaust the resources of web servers, databases, and other applications.
- Difficult to detect as they can mimic legitimate user behavior.

**Example Attack – HTTP GET/POST Flood**:
- **Description**: The attacker sends numerous HTTP GET or POST requests to overload the web server. These requests are designed to retrieve data-intensive pages or submit forms, thus exhausting the application server.
- **Mitigation**: Employing Web Application Firewalls (WAF), rate limiting, anomaly detection, and challenge-response authentication mechanisms like CAPTCHAs.

### Fourth Generation – Multi-vector Attacks

**Characteristics**:
- Concurrent use of multiple attack vectors (volumetric, protocol, and application layer attacks).
- Sophistication in targeting different infrastructure components at once.
- Challenging for defenders due to the simultaneous diversification of attack methods.

**Example Attack – Simultaneous Volumetric and Application Layer Attacks**:
- **Description**: An attacker may launch a volumetric UDP flood to saturate the network bandwidth while also executing a Slowloris attack to keep web server connections open indefinitely, requiring defenses to cope with issues at both the network and application layers.
- **Mitigation**: Multi-layered security approaches, adaptive DDoS protection systems, and comprehensive monitoring to identify and mitigate diverse threat vectors.

### Fifth Generation – Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS)

**Characteristics**:
- Targeted, strategic assaults often aimed at high-profile targets such as financial institutions or governmental agencies.
- Use of evasion techniques to bypass standard defense mechanisms.
- Long-term approach, adapting to defender's responses, and often cycling through attack vectors.

**Example Attack – Highly Sophisticated Multi-vector Attacks with Evasion Techniques**:
- **Description**: APDoS attacks might use combinations of encrypted attacks, mimic user behavior to evade detection, and employ botnets for amplification and persistence, often switching tactics to stay ahead of defensive measures.
- **Mitigation**: Extensive, continuous security analysis, deployment of advanced behavioral analytics, incident response teams, and cooperation with ISPs and cloud-based DDoS mitigation services.

In conclusion, each generation of DDoS attacks reflects an evolution in strategy, complexity, and sophistication. Defenders must continuously adapt their security postures to anticipate future developments and safeguard their networks and services against the ever-changing landscape of DDoS threats.

- **Duration and Persistence**: Unlike traditional DDoS attacks that are typically short-lived, APDoS attacks can be sustained over extended periods, sometimes weeks or even months, which exhausts the victim's resources and resilience.

- **Adaptability**: Attackers behind APDoS campaigns are known to monitor the effectiveness of their attacks and adjust their strategies accordingly to bypass the implemented defenses.

- **Evasion Techniques**: APDoS attacks often use advanced evasion techniques, such as encryption and mimicking legitimate user behavior to avoid detection by standard security tools.

- **Targeted**: These attacks are usually targeted at high-profile and high-value targets, such as banks, large corporations, government websites, and critical infrastructure.

- **Resourcefulness**: Attackers may employ significant resources including extensive botnets, reflective amplification methods, and other malicious actors to carry out the attack.

#### Popular Attack Event:

An example of a notable fifth-generation DDoS attack event is not specifically mentioned due to real-world events constantly evolving beyond my knowledge cutoff in 2023. However, financial institutions, gaming services, and large internet platforms have been frequent targets of sophisticated DDoS campaigns due to their visibility and impact.

#### Defense Method:

Addressing fifth-generation APDoS attacks requires a comprehensive, multi-layered defense strategy. Key defensive methods include:

- **Behavioral Analytics**: Using advanced analytics to detect abnormal traffic patterns and behaviors that could signify an APDoS attack.

- **Incident Response Team**: A dedicated team that can quickly respond to emerging threats and adapt defenses in real time is crucial.

  - Infrastructure-level protection: Redundant network architecture, rate limiting, and IP blacklisting/whitelisting.
  - Cloud-based scrubbing centers: Leveraging cloud services that can absorb and filter DDoS traffic outside the organization's network.

- **Cooperation with third-party DDoS mitigation services and ISPs**: Engaging with external specialists who can offer additional capacity and specialized capabilities.

- **Regular Testing and Simulation**: Performing regular DDoS simulation exercises to test resilience and response protocols.

Defense against fifth-generation DDoS attacks must be dynamic and adaptive, given the sophistication and changing tactics used by attackers. It is vital to integrate real-time monitoring, robust infrastructure, collaboration with experts and service providers, and continually updated incident response plans.


### First Generation – Basic Volumetric Attacks

#### Characteristics:

- **Simplicity**: The first generation of DDoS attacks were relatively simple and crude in their method, primarily targeting the network bandwidth.

- **Volume-Based**: These attacks aim to consume the bandwidth of the victim's network, either within the target's immediate network infrastructure or between the target and the rest of the internet. 

- **Direct Attack Vectors**: They often consist of direct flooding techniques such as ICMP floods, UDP floods, and other packet-based attacks.

- **Short Duration**: Initially, these attacks would typically last for a short period as they had a quick impact, and attackers had fewer resources to sustain them for longer.

- **Little Variation**: Attackers used limited strategies, and the variability of the attacks was minimal due to the rudimentary nature of the tools available at that time.

#### Popular Attack Event:

One of the earliest recorded DDoS attacks occurred in August 1999, when a computer at the University of Minnesota was attacked with a SYN flood, disrupting its connectivity. This marked one of the inaugural events that brought attention to the concept of distributed denial-of-service attacks.

#### Defense Method:

Defense against first-generation DDoS attacks involves straightforward techniques because the attacks themselves are not complex:

- **Firewalls and Routers**: Basic firewall and router configurations can be used to filter out malicious traffic based on source IP addresses or unusual traffic patterns.

- **Bandwidth Overprovisioning**: Simply having more bandwidth than you expect to need could allow an organization to absorb the impact of an attack.

- **Rate Limiting**: Routers and firewalls can be configured to limit the rate of requests from a particular source.

- **Anomaly Detection**: Basic anomaly detection methods may include identifying spikes in traffic which deviate from normal baselines.

#### Duration:

The duration of first-generation DDoS attacks could vary, but many were short-lived, ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. During the early days of such attacks, this was partly due to the limited resources attackers had at their disposal and the relatively unsophisticated nature of their methods. Quick responses and simple mitigations were usually enough to restore service in a short period of time.


### Second Generation – Application Layer Attacks

#### Characteristics:

- **Targeting Applications**: The second generation of DDoS attacks moved beyond simple volumetric tactics to target the application layer. These are known as Layer 7 attacks.

- **Sophistication**: These attacks became more sophisticated, exploiting specific features or vulnerabilities in web applications to disable services.

- **Consumes Less Bandwidth**: Unlike volumetric attacks, application layer attacks don't necessarily require a lot of bandwidth to be effective, making them harder to detect.

- **Longer Durations**: As attackers developed more intelligent tools to automate attacks, they could sustain their efforts for longer periods.

- **Resource Starvation**: Instead of flooding the network, these attacks aim to exhaust the resources on a web server, such as the CPU and memory.

- **Mimic Legitimate Traffic**: Often designed to appear as legitimate traffic, which requires more advanced detection methods.

#### Popular Attack Event:

One notable application layer attack event was the DDoS attack on GitHub in March 2015. This was one of the largest and longest-lasting DDoS attacks reported at that time, using an amplification technique via China's search engine Baidu to generate traffic volumes as high as 1.35 Tbps.

#### Defense Method:

Defense strategies against second-generation DDoS attacks are more complex due to their subtle nature:

- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: WAFs can inspect HTTP traffic and block requests that appear to be part of an attack.

- **Behavioral Analysis**: Solutions that can track and analyze user behavior to distinguish between normal users and attackers.

- **Rate-Based and Session Tracking**: Implement rate-based policies and session tracking to identify and block abnormal patterns.

- **Scrubbing Services**: Use DDoS protection services that filter out malicious traffic before it reaches the target server.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Helps protect against certain types of application-layer attacks that rely on exploiting weaknesses in authentication mechanisms.

#### Duration:

The duration of these attacks typically exceeds that of first-generation attacks, with incidents ranging from several hours to days. The complexity of identifying genuine traffic from attack traffic makes the mitigation process lengthier and more challenging.

Each generational shift in cyber threats reflects technological advancements and the resultant change in attack surfaces. As technology evolves, so too do the capabilities of attackers, requiring a continuous adaptation of defense strategies to protect against ever-more complex and stealthy attacks.


Apologies for any confusion caused. In detailing the generations of cyber threats, I provided information on four distinctive generations, often seen in the evolution of malware and cyber-attack strategies. It is important to note that there is no universally agreed upon number of generations as the landscape of cyber threats continuously evolves, and different sources may categorize them differently based on their criteria.

The overview I provided is based on significant shifts in technology and methods used by attackers across different time periods. Cybersecurity experts often debate the specifics of these generations and when one transitions into another, especially given the rapid advancement of technology.

Here's a recap of the four generations mentioned:

1. **First Generation (1980s to mid-1990s)**: Basic viruses and worms spread via physical media.
2. **Second Generation (mid-1990s to early 2000s)**: Internet-exploiting worms using network vulnerabilities.
3. **Third Generation (early 2000s to around 2010)**: Exploit kits, botnets, and monetization techniques.
4. **Fourth Generation (around 2010 to present)**: Blended attacks with advanced evasion techniques and APTs.

Each generation reflects a period where certain types of cyber threats were prevalent or introduced significant new challenges. The defense strategies also evolved correspondingly to address the new kinds of risks. Keep in mind that this segmentation is not absolute, and there can be overlaps and continuous developments within each "generation."

# Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is a crucial technique used to control the amount of incoming requests a user can make to an API, web server, or network infrastructure within a certain time window. By slowing down the traffic, it helps protect resources from being overwhelmed and ensures fair usage among all users.

## Technologies and Methods

### Token Bucket Algorithm
- **Function**: Uses tokens to measure allowable traffic; tokens are added at a steady rate, governing request allowance.
- **Details**: Allows for bursts up to bucket capacity, smoothing out bursty traffic.

### Leaky Bucket Algorithm
- **Function**: Requests are processed at a fixed rate; excess requests are queued or dropped.
- **Details**: Enforces a strict output rate, preventing bursts but potentially increasing latency.

### Fixed Window Counters
- **Function**: Limits are enforced based on fixed time windows (e.g., per minute/hour).
- **Details**: Easy to implement but can allow bursts if requests are timed around window boundaries.

### Sliding Log Algorithm
- **Function**: Tracks request timestamps in a log to calculate counts dynamically.
- **Details**: Offers more flexibility and fairness over fixed windows but is resource-intensive.

### Sliding Window Counter
- **Function**: A hybrid approach that combines the simplicity of fixed counters and the evenness of sliding logs.

4. **Network Segmentation:** Segmenting the network into smaller, isolated subnets can help contain the impact of ARP flooding attacks. By limiting the scope of ARP traffic within individual network segments, organizations can minimize the potential disruption caused by ARP cache poisoning and mitigate the spread of the attack.

5. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Deploying IDPS solutions that can monitor and analyze network traffic for signs of ARP flooding attacks can help organizations detect and respond to these threats in real time. IDPS solutions can be configured to identify abnormal ARP traffic patterns and trigger automated responses to mitigate the impact of the attack.

6. **ARP Cache Timeout Settings:** Adjusting the ARP cache timeout settings on network devices can help reduce the impact of ARP flooding attacks. Shortening the duration for which ARP cache entries are retained can limit the effectiveness of ARP cache poisoning and decrease the window of opportunity for attackers to disrupt network communication.

7. **Network Access Control (NAC):** Implementing NAC solutions can help enforce access policies and authenticate devices before they are allowed to communicate on the network. By verifying the identity and integrity of devices connecting to the network, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized ARP traffic manipulation.

By implementing these defense methods, organizations can enhance the resilience of their network infrastructure and reduce the susceptibility to ARP flooding attacks, helping to maintain the availability and security of their local area networks.


SYN flooding attacks are a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the TCP handshake process to overwhelm a target server with a flood of spoofed or illegitimate TCP SYN packets. These attacks can disrupt the normal operation of a server and lead to a denial of service for legitimate users. To defend against SYN flooding attacks, organizations can implement various defense methods, including:

1. **SYN Cookies:** SYN cookies are a defense mechanism built into some operating systems and network devices to mitigate the impact of SYN flooding attacks. When enabled, SYN cookies allow a server to respond to incoming SYN packets without allocating resources until the completion of the TCP handshake, which helps protect against resource exhaustion caused by a large volume of half-open connections.

2. **Firewalls and Rate Limiting:** Deploying firewalls and network devices with rate-limiting capabilities can help filter and control incoming SYN packets. By setting thresholds for the rate of incoming TCP SYN packets, organizations can limit the impact of SYN flooding attacks and prevent the exhaustion of server resources.

3. **TCP SYN Proxy:** Implementing a TCP SYN proxy can help protect servers from the effects of SYN flooding attacks. A SYN proxy can intercept incoming SYN packets and establish the full TCP connection on behalf of the server, effectively shielding the server from the flood of half-open connections and reducing the risk of resource depletion.

4. **Increasing Backlog Queue Size:** Adjusting the backlog queue size on servers can help mitigate the impact of SYN flooding attacks. By increasing the capacity of the backlog queue, servers can better handle incoming connection requests during peak periods and reduce the likelihood of exhausting resources due to a high volume of pending connections.

SYN cookies are a technique used to mitigate the impact of SYN flooding attacks, a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that targets the TCP handshake process. When a client initiates a TCP connection with a server, it sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server, which then responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet, and the client completes the handshake by sending an ACK (acknowledgment) packet. In a SYN flooding attack, the attacker floods the server with a large volume of SYN packets, but does not complete the handshake by sending the final ACK packet. This results in the server maintaining a large number of half-open connections, consuming resources and potentially leading to a denial of service.

SYN cookies were developed as a defense mechanism against SYN flooding attacks. When SYN cookies are enabled on a server, the server does not allocate resources for half-open connections until the completion of the TCP handshake. Instead, the server generates a SYN-ACK response to the client's SYN packet, but the response includes a specially crafted SYN cookie. This SYN cookie contains encoded information about the connection, such as the initial sequence number and other details needed to reconstruct the connection state.

When the client responds with the ACK packet, it includes the SYN cookie generated by the server. The server then verifies the integrity of the SYN cookie and uses the information encoded in the cookie to reconstruct the connection state without having to maintain a full connection state for every incoming SYN packet. This allows the server to handle a large number of incoming connection requests while minimizing the impact of SYN flooding attacks and conserving resources.

Key characteristics of SYN cookies include:

1. **Stateless Handling of SYN Packets:** SYN cookies enable stateless handling of incoming SYN packets, allowing servers to respond to connection requests without maintaining a full connection state until the completion of the TCP handshake.

2. **Protection Against Resource Exhaustion:** By using SYN cookies, servers can protect against resource exhaustion caused by a high volume of half-open connections resulting from SYN flooding attacks, as the server does not need to allocate resources until the completion of the handshake.

3. **Encoded Connection Information:** SYN cookies encode essential connection information within the SYN-ACK response, allowing the server to reconstruct the connection state when the client responds with the ACK packet containing the SYN cookie.

4. **Scalability and Resilience:** SYN cookies help improve the scalability and resilience of servers by reducing the impact of SYN flooding attacks and enabling them to handle a larger number of incoming connection requests.

Overall, SYN cookies provide an effective defense mechanism against SYN flooding attacks, helping to maintain the availability and performance of network services by mitigating the impact of malicious SYN traffic.

This can lead to degraded performance, unresponsiveness, or complete downtime for the targeted web applications and services.

5. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Defending against HTTP flood attacks requires implementing robust mitigation strategies, such as deploying web application firewalls (WAFs) to filter out malicious traffic, implementing rate limiting to control the volume of incoming requests, leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs) to absorb and mitigate attack traffic, and utilizing behavioral analysis to identify and block anomalous request patterns.

6. **Challenges in Detection:**
   - Detecting and mitigating HTTP flood attacks can be challenging due to the need to differentiate between legitimate user traffic and malicious bot-generated requests. Implementing sophisticated traffic analysis and anomaly detection mechanisms can help identify and mitigate HTTP flood attacks without impacting legitimate users.

7. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Organizations can proactively protect against HTTP flood attacks by optimizing web server configurations, implementing caching mechanisms, and utilizing load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities to distribute and absorb traffic spikes. Additionally, conducting regular security assessments and penetration testing can help identify and remediate vulnerabilities that could be exploited in HTTP flood attacks.

In summary, HTTP flood attacks pose a significant threat to web servers and web applications, and organizations need to implement comprehensive security measures to defend against these attacks. By leveraging a combination of protective technologies, including WAFs, rate limiting, CDNs, and behavioral analysis, organizations can enhance their resilience against HTTP flood attacks and maintain the availability and integrity of their web-based services.


**Slowloris Attack:**

A Slowloris attack is a type of application layer DDoS attack that targets web servers by exploiting the way HTTP connections are handled. The attack is characterized by its ability to consume server resources and prevent new connections from being established, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. The attack is named after the slow loris, a primate known for its slow movements, reflecting the gradual and persistent nature of the attack.

**Attack Technology:**

- **Persistent Partial HTTP Requests:** Slowloris attacks work by sending partial, legitimate HTTP requests to the target web server, but deliberately keeping the connections open by sending periodic header and body fragments. By maintaining a large number of open connections without completing the requests, the attacker can exhaust the server's capacity to handle new connections, leading to a denial of service.

- **Low Bandwidth Utilization:** Unlike traditional DDoS attacks that flood the network with high volumes of traffic, Slowloris attacks can be effective with relatively low bandwidth utilization. This makes it challenging to detect and mitigate the attack using traditional network-based DDoS mitigation techniques.

**Defense Technology:**

- **Connection Timeouts and Limits:** Web server administrators can implement connection timeouts and limits to restrict the maximum duration and number of open connections from a single client. By enforcing these limits, servers can mitigate the impact of Slowloris attacks by closing idle connections and preventing new connections from being established by the attacker.

- **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can be configured to detect and block suspicious HTTP traffic patterns associated with Slowloris attacks. WAFs can analyze the behavior of incoming requests and enforce policies to mitigate the impact of slow and partial HTTP requests, thereby protecting web servers from resource exhaustion.

- **Rate Limiting and Connection Pooling:** Implementing rate limiting mechanisms and connection pooling techniques can help mitigate the impact of Slowloris attacks by managing the allocation of server resources and preventing the exhaustion of available connections.

**Characteristics:**

- **Low and Slow Attack:** Slowloris attacks are characterized by their low and slow approach, where the attacker maintains a large number of open connections with minimal bandwidth usage. This allows the attack to evade detection based on traffic volume alone, making it challenging to mitigate using traditional DDoS defense mechanisms.

- **Resource Exhaustion:** The primary goal of Slowloris attacks is to exhaust server resources, particularly the capacity to establish new connections. By keeping existing connections open, the attacker prevents legitimate users from accessing the web server, leading to denial of service.

- **Persistent and Gradual:** Slowloris attacks are persistent and gradual in nature, as the attacker continuously sends partial HTTP requests and maintains open connections over an extended period. This gradual approach allows the attacker to sustain the impact on the target server and prolong the denial of service condition.

In summary, Slowloris attacks pose a unique threat to web servers by leveraging persistent partial HTTP requests to exhaust server resources and disrupt the availability of web services. Defending against Slowloris attacks requires a combination of server-side connection management, WAFs, rate limiting, and connection pooling to mitigate the impact of slow and persistent connection-based DDoS attacks.


I understand, and I apologize for any confusion. Typically, SYN flood attacks are associated with Layer 4 of the OSI model, targeting the TCP handshake process. However, if you are referring to a specific type of Layer 7 attack that involves SYN floods, it may involve a combination of techniques to exploit vulnerabilities at the application layer while also leveraging the characteristics of a SYN flood attack.

**Layer 7 SYN Flood Attack (Hypothetical Scenario):**

In a hypothetical scenario where a Layer 7 SYN flood attack is mentioned, it could involve an attack that combines the characteristics of a traditional SYN flood with application-layer vulnerabilities to create a more sophisticated and targeted DDoS attack. This hypothetical attack could aim to exploit specific application-layer weaknesses while also overwhelming the server's TCP connection handling capabilities.

**Attack Technology:**

- **Exploiting Application Layer Vulnerabilities:** The attacker may target vulnerabilities in the application layer, such as HTTP, HTTPS, or other Layer 7 protocols, to exploit weaknesses in web server software, database systems, or other application components.

- **Simultaneous SYN Flood and Layer 7 Exploitation:** The attack could involve flooding the target server with a high volume of SYN requests while simultaneously exploiting application-layer vulnerabilities to consume additional resources or disrupt specific services at Layer 7.

**Defense Technology:**

- **Application Layer Firewalls and WAFs:** Implementing web application firewalls (WAFs) and application layer firewalls can help detect and mitigate attacks targeting specific application-layer vulnerabilities, including those combined with SYN flood techniques.

- **Behavioral Analysis and Anomaly Detection:** Utilizing behavioral analysis and anomaly detection mechanisms can help identify unusual patterns of traffic that may indicate a combination of Layer 7 exploitation and SYN flood activity, allowing for proactive mitigation.

- **Rate Limiting and Connection Pooling:** Employing rate limiting mechanisms and connection pooling techniques at the application layer can help manage the impact of simultaneous SYN flood and Layer 7 attacks by controlling the allocation of resources and connections.

**Characteristics:**

- **Targeted Application Layer Exploitation:** A Layer 7 SYN flood attack may involve the targeted exploitation of application-layer vulnerabilities to disrupt specific services or components, combined with the resource exhaustion caused by the SYN flood.

- **Complex Attack Vector:** This hypothetical attack vector combines the complexities of Layer 7 application layer vulnerabilities with the resource exhaustion and disruption caused by the traditional SYN flood attack, requiring a multifaceted defense strategy.

It's important to note that while the concept of a Layer 7 SYN flood attack is not a standard terminology, the hypothetical scenario described above illustrates a potential combination of techniques to create a more sophisticated and targeted DDoS attack. As with any DDoS attack, defending against such a hypothetical attack would require a comprehensive defense strategy that addresses both Layer 7 application layer vulnerabilities and Layer 4 resource exhaustion caused by SYN flood techniques.


Certainly! Slow POST and Slow Read attacks are types of Layer 7 (application layer) DDoS attacks that exploit the characteristics of the HTTP protocol to disrupt web server performance. These attacks involve sending HTTP requests in a slow and gradual manner, causing the server to allocate resources for extended periods of time, ultimately leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service for legitimate users. Below are the details about these attacks, including attack and defense technologies, as well as their characteristics.

**Characteristics:**

- **Gradual Resource Consumption:** Slow POST attacks gradually consume server resources by maintaining incomplete HTTP POST requests, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service for legitimate users.

- **Long Duration:** These attacks can be sustained over extended periods of time, as the gradual nature of the data transmission prolongs the impact on server resources.

**Slow Read Attack:**

**Attack Technology:**

- **Slow Data Retrieval:** In a Slow Read attack, the attacker sends HTTP GET requests to the target server and retrieves the response data at a very slow rate, intentionally prolonging the duration of the request and response exchange.

- **Resource Starvation:** By intentionally delaying the retrieval of response data, the attacker can tie up server resources, such as available connections, processing threads, or memory, leading to resource exhaustion and degraded performance.

**Defense Technology:**

- **Connection and Session Timeout Management:** Implementing connection and session timeout management mechanisms can help terminate prolonged and unreasonably slow client connections, freeing up resources for legitimate traffic.

- **Rate Limiting and Bandwidth Management:** Utilizing rate limiting and bandwidth management techniques can help control the impact of Slow Read attacks by preventing excessive consumption of server resources by slow or prolonged data retrieval.

**Characteristics:**

- **Prolonged Resource Consumption:** Slow Read attacks prolong the consumption of server resources by delaying the retrieval of response data, leading to resource exhaustion and degraded performance for legitimate users.

- **Impact on Scalability:** These attacks can impact the scalability of web servers and application infrastructure by tying up available connections and processing threads, hindering the ability to handle legitimate traffic.

In summary, Slow POST and Slow Read attacks are Layer 7 DDoS attack vectors that exploit the characteristics of the HTTP protocol to consume server resources in a slow and deliberate manner, ultimately leading to denial of service for legitimate users. Defending against these attacks requires the implementation of timeout mechanisms, rate limiting, and bandwidth management techniques to mitigate the impact of prolonged resource consumption caused by slow and deliberate data transmission.


Certainly! XML/SOAP Payload Attacks are a type of Layer 7 (application layer) DDoS attack that targets web services and APIs which utilize XML and SOAP-based communication protocols. These attacks involve sending specially crafted XML payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in the XML parsing and processing capabilities of the target server, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service. Below are the details about the attack and defense technologies for XML/SOAP Payload Attacks.

**Attack Technologies:**

- **XML Bomb:** Attackers can craft XML payloads designed to exploit the recursive nature of XML parsing, creating a large and deeply nested XML document that consumes excessive memory and processing resources when parsed by the server.

- **Entity Expansion:** By including entity expansion references in the XML payload, attackers can cause the server to expand these entities into large amounts of data, overwhelming the server's memory and processing capabilities.

- **SOAP Array Expansion:** In SOAP-based services, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities related to the processing of arrays, causing the server to allocate excessive resources to handle large and complex array structures.

**Defense Technologies:**

- **XML Payload Validation:** Implementing strict input validation and schema validation for incoming XML payloads can help detect and reject malformed or excessively large XML documents, preventing the exploitation of XML parsing vulnerabilities.

- **XML Parsers Hardening:** Employing hardened XML parsers that enforce limits on document size, depth of nesting, and entity expansion can help mitigate the impact of XML/SOAP Payload Attacks by preventing the exploitation of XML parsing vulnerabilities.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Utilizing rate limiting and request throttling mechanisms to control the rate and volume of incoming XML/SOAP requests can help mitigate the impact of XML/SOAP Payload Attacks by preventing the rapid influx of malicious requests.

- **Resource Quotas and Limits:** Implementing resource quotas and limits for XML parsing and processing operations can help prevent excessive resource consumption by malicious XML payloads, ensuring that server resources are not exhausted by processing large and complex XML documents.

**Characteristics:**

- **Resource Exhaustion:** XML/SOAP Payload Attacks aim to exhaust server resources, such as memory, CPU, and parsing capabilities, by exploiting vulnerabilities in the processing of XML payloads, leading to denial of service for legitimate users.

- **Complex Payloads:** Attackers craft complex and specially designed XML payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsing and processing, aiming to overwhelm the target server with resource-intensive operations.

In summary, XML/SOAP Payload Attacks target web services and APIs that use XML and SOAP-based communication protocols, aiming to exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsing and processing capabilities. Defending against these attacks involves implementing strict input validation, hardened XML parsers, rate limiting, and resource quotas to mitigate the impact of resource exhaustion caused by malicious XML payloads.


Certainly! DNS Query Floods are a type of DDoS attack that targets the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure by overwhelming DNS servers with a high volume of malicious DNS queries. These attacks disrupt the resolution of domain names to IP addresses, leading to denial of service for legitimate users. Below are the details about the attack and defense technologies for DNS Query Floods.

**Attack Technologies:**

- **Amplification:** Attackers use DNS amplification techniques to magnify the volume of DNS traffic directed at the target server. By sending spoofed DNS queries with the source IP address of the victim, attackers can elicit large responses from open DNS resolvers, amplifying the impact of the attack.

- **Random Subdomain Requests:** Attackers may generate a flood of random subdomain requests for a specific domain, overwhelming the DNS server with a large number of unique queries that require processing and resolution.

- **Botnet-based Attacks:** Botnets are often utilized to launch DNS Query Floods, with a large number of compromised devices coordinating to send a barrage of DNS queries to the target server, increasing the volume and impact of the attack.

**Defense Technologies:**

- **Anycast DNS Infrastructure:** Implementing an anycast DNS infrastructure can help distribute DNS query traffic across multiple geographically distributed servers, providing redundancy and scalability to mitigate the impact of DNS Query Floods.

- **DNS Response Rate Limiting (RRL):** RRL is a technique that limits the rate of DNS responses sent by a server, effectively mitigating the amplification effect of DNS amplification attacks and reducing the impact of DNS Query Floods.

- **DNS Query Filtering:** Employing DNS query filtering mechanisms to identify and block malicious or anomalous DNS queries can help mitigate the impact of DNS Query Floods by preventing the processing of illegitimate requests.

- **Traffic Scrubbing and Filtering:** Utilizing traffic scrubbing and filtering services can help identify and mitigate malicious DNS query traffic, allowing legitimate DNS requests to be processed while blocking or mitigating the impact of the attack traffic.

**Characteristics:**

- **Volume-based Attack:** DNS Query Floods overwhelm DNS servers with a high volume of malicious DNS queries, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service for legitimate users.

- **Amplification and Reflection:** Attackers may leverage amplification techniques and open DNS resolvers to amplify the volume of DNS traffic directed at the target server, increasing the impact of the attack.

In summary, DNS Query Floods are a type of DDoS attack that targets the DNS infrastructure by flooding DNS servers with a high volume of malicious queries. Defending against these attacks involves implementing anycast DNS infrastructure, DNS response rate limiting, query filtering, and traffic scrubbing to mitigate the impact of DNS Query Floods and ensure the availability of DNS services for legitimate users.
